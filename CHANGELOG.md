# Changelog

The curated history of the ceremony itself. Each release's section is
published verbatim as that release's body (lib/changelog.sh extracts it),
so entries say what changed, cite the issue, and stop — at most 300
characters each, guard-enforced on the PR that writes the fragment (#167);
a genuinely long change ships several short entries, never one long one.
The citation is guard-enforced too, and it closes the entry: one `(#N)`
group, then the final `.` and nothing after it (#262). Sections published
before that rule keep their prose; the guard reads fragments only.
Entries arrive as fragments — one `changelog.d/<issue>.md` per PR, never
an edit to this file — and the release PR assembles them into the next
section here (`bin/changelog-assemble`, #112).

## 0.7.10 — 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Several release tracks are now documented as one caller job with a matrix leg per track (`max-parallel: 1`, `fail-fast: false`), not one job per track: `docs-sync` needs a single pin line, and serial legs never race their re-arm pushes to `main` (#623).

## 0.7.9 — 2026-09-24

### Added

- Release tracks: `release.yml` takes `path` and `tag-prefix`, so one repository can release several apps on their own version lines, each with its own `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, tags and re-arm. The defaults change nothing (#618).
- The version guards take a `path` input, and the artifact hook gets `RELEASE_TAG` and `RELEASE_TRACK_PATH`, so each release track is checked and packaged on its own files (#618).
- Mechanise the `0.6.0` upgrade crossing through the existing doctrine mirror sync while leaving the optional refs guard for consumers to adopt. (#605).
- `ceremony-upgrade` performs the `0.7.8` guarded-scaffold crossing and says
  that its final mirror re-sync writes the pull request template block (#602).
- `bin/ceremony-upgrade` performs `0.5.0` instead of refusing it. The tag asks
  a forward-moving tree for nothing, so the run is the ref bump and the mirror
  re-sync, and the plan says which section of `docs/CONSUMERS.md` says why
  (#600).
- Two mechanised tags now, so a consumer at `0.3.0` reaches `0.5.0` in two
  runs — one rung each, `0.4.1` then `0.5.0`, never both in one (#600).
- `bin/ceremony-upgrade` performs `0.4.1`'s two-caller split instead of
  refusing it: it writes the sweep caller from `docs/CONSUMERS.md`'s own stub
  at that tag, relocates the labels caller's cron unchanged, and grants
  `actions: write` (#597).
- An applied step stops at the first crossed tag, reporting the pin it left
  behind and what remains; a shape it cannot anchor refuses, tree untouched,
  and every other migration tag refuses exactly as before (#597).

### Changed

- The issue contract separates a spec whose own question is open from one
  scoped around a question live elsewhere: the second is mintable, every
  mandating clause carries the scope in its own text, and a mint never
  asserts what the prose it commissions cannot reach (#615).
- Builders and reviewers now compare a `Closes #N` head's closing-issue graph against what the PR body declares, re-reading it after the last body edit, and sweep every copy of a quoted sentence that enrols an issue (#613).
- `ceremony-upgrade` now crosses `0.7.0` for you instead of refusing. The tag asks a forward-moving tree for nothing — the release workflow's inputs are unchanged in name and requiredness across it — so the crossing is the refs and the mirror re-sync (#610).
- Five of the eight migration rows are now mechanised. A consumer pinned `0.3.0` climbs to `0.7.8` one rung per run with no hand-only wall left on that path (#610).

### Fixed

- `refs-not-closing` shows the `Refs` occurrence that produced the
  intersection rather than a correct `Closes` line, and picks the remedy
  per number: a quoted-only one is sent to de-parse the archived record's
  tokens and to leave its own closing sentence alone (#606).
- The `actions:` grant refusal names line endings when a CRLF caller is the
  only difference, instead of printing the same word on both sides of a
  sentence saying they differ (#600).
- The sweep caller's `with:` is written at the published stub's own indent
  rather than a hard-coded four spaces, and a stub the step cannot read that
  from fails loudly (#600).
- Name the commit message as a second closing carrier in `BUILDER.md` and
  `REVIEWER.md`, scope the closing-issue graph's authority to the PR body,
  and send a reviewer at a `Refs` head to the PR's commit list (#591).
- Make crossed-migration refusals name the first wall, explain the hand ref
  move, and emit only a proven shorter step or an explicit no-step result (#588).
- State the release PR's fragment exception where every builder reads it,
  including both closed guard paths and the ordinary-PR alternative (#583).

## 0.7.8 — 2026-08-31

### Added

- Adoption now ends by recording the board in the operator's catalog:
  `docs/CONSUMERS.md`'s bootstrap and conversion checklists both carry the
  step, and neither names a repository or a filename as the destination
  (#576).
- The cost of skipping it is stated where the step is: a board absent from
  the catalog is not enumerated by the censuses that a taxonomy change, a
  pin bump or a label retirement each run first (#576).
- Added a sweep-derived `builder` owner-class label as the complement of hand-set `operator`. (#562).
- `bin/ceremony-upgrade` moves a consumer's every ceremony `uses:` reference to
  one tag and re-syncs the doctrine mirror by calling `docs-sync --fix`.
  `--check` is the default and changes not one byte; `--source <dir>` previews
  a move against an unreleased ceremony tree (#561).
- The pin move refuses where it would cross a migration — a tag whose
  `docs/CONSUMERS.md` note asks something of the consumer's tree — naming every
  crossed tag in order with its section, and refuses a tree with no pin, an
  ungradeable pin, a target that was never cut, and a downgrade (#561).
- A refused move leaves the tree byte-identical, however deep the refusal
  comes from: `--fix` snapshots everything it and `docs-sync` can touch before
  the first byte, verifies the rewrite against the plan it announced, and
  restores the snapshot on any failure — a `docs-sync` refusal included (#561).
- `docs-sync` gains a third file class, the guarded scaffold: ceremony owns a
  marked block in the consumer's `.github/pull_request_template.md` and the
  consumer owns every byte outside it, so a repo-specific template stops
  drifting from the engine that renders into it (#559).
- The scaffolded set is read from the pin's `docs/SCAFFOLDED.txt`, so a bump
  that adds or drops one re-shapes it with no second list; the bump and the
  `docs-sync --fix` run are one PR (#559).
- `docs-sync --fix` now says where its changes landed when a guarded scaffold
  is among them, instead of reporting `.ceremony/` for work outside it; a run
  with no scaffold work prints the sentence it always has (#559).
- A fleet-worked repository with no ceremony pin reads doctrine at the latest published, non-draft, non-prerelease ceremony release tag rather than `main`, and `docs/CONSUMERS.md` names the command that resolves it (#558).

### Changed

- `TRIAGE.md`'s builder-owned paragraph no longer assumes every builder
  session has the same boundary: such a criterion may require a named session
  capability, and where it does it says so in its own text (#575).
- That statement carries three things — builder-owned and not operator-owned,
  the capability required, and that a builder lacking it releases the claim
  rather than substituting documentation for the evidence (#575).
- The reach axis stays two-valued: a named capability is a property of the
  criterion and not a third owner class, so an issue whose criteria name one
  is builder-owned like any other (#575).
- Clarify that `operator` covers external conditions only the operator can resolve, while excluding third-party waits (#573).
- Made the fleet-wide claim-slot assertion an explicit precondition and documented recovery from a false assertion. (#565).
- Document that doctrine-mirrored repositories carry a release caller even without artifact publication, and make `docs-sync` say so when it is missing (#553).
- Retired creation of the `post-merge` queue row while leaving existing consumer label objects in place, and clarified re-flag ladder carve-outs. (#540, #544).
- Triage now splits after-close work at the mint: a criterion whose evidence cannot exist before the PR merges is not carried by the issue at all, but minted as its own issue declaring the first as its blocker (#151, #536).
- The successor issue carries the outstanding criteria verbatim, has one owner class, and names its evidence surface, its command or observation, and its wake condition (#536).
- A same-repo PR always carries `Closes #N`. A criterion a builder cannot check before the merge is a defect in the issue, reported to triage, never a reason to write `Refs #N` (#151, #536).
- `Refs #N` on an acceptance-criteria PR is no longer blessed by the reviewer authority list; the shape is now the round-cap cut predecessor's alone (#536).
- The `post-merge` completion queue is retired; merge-door splitting now keeps after-close work out of the closing issue entirely (#538, #540).
- `TRIAGE.md`'s reach axis names no repealed mechanism: reach is the one axis classified at mint. The three-part evidence rule, #491's issue-level reversal and the verbatim relocation are unchanged (#536).
- Let triage batch relocated operator-owned criteria when one invocation on the same evidence surface proves them, while keeping batching optional and forbidding cross-surface batches (#532).
- Require shared operator issues to enumerate criteria per origin and let each gated issue declare the shared operator node alone (#532).
- A `needs-ruling` flag borne by an issue whose escalation reads `Default: none — hard block` no longer fires the ladder's 24h and past-24h rungs. The flag waits for the human and no timer replaces them (#490, #526).
- The setter now owes a published re-read of the default at each of those two rungs — the 12h rung's act extended, so the carve-out adds a duty rather than removing one (#490, #526).
- Record why the late rungs are carved out: their safety is the merge gate, and on an issue there is no second look, so the pick is terminal (#490, #526).
- State the carve-out's three exclusions. A PR-borne flag runs the full ladder; an issue-borne timed reversible default still expires at 0–12h; the 0–12h and 12h rungs are unchanged on every surface (#526).
- Say in one sentence that a discussion carries no `labeled` event and therefore no ladder, which the anchor rule already implied (#490, #526).
- `TRIAGE.md` outcome 3's past-24h duty to pick now reads as conditional rather than unconditional, matching the ladder's two other copies (#526).
- Relocate operator-owned acceptance criteria into their own issue instead of holding the original open: the remainder is left wholly PR-checkable and its PR merges with `Closes #N` (#488, #525).
- Require the relocation to happen before the merge, and to enumerate the moved criteria one at a time on both the new issue and the original (#488, #525).
- An issue is now builder-owned or operator-owned and never both, replacing the rule that a lone operator-owned criterion left the issue unmarked (#491, #488).
- Read issue ownership off its criteria's class. The two axes stay independent per criterion; only the issue level collapses (#491, #488).
- Give a relocated issue `ready` + `operator` at its own mint, carrying the evidence surface, the command or observation, and the wake condition (#488, #525).
- Add the `builder-owned issue -> operator-owned issue -> gated issue` graph to Dependencies. The gated issue declares the operator-owned one alone (#488, #525).
- Rewrite builder park shape 3 as the transient wait for triage's relocation, keeping its number. An operator-owned remainder no longer parks a finished claim (#488, #336).
- Make a governed board's label-taxonomy repair operator-owned and exempt it from issue minting when required queue labels are missing (#524).

### Fixed

- Put the engine-mediated panel-request exception beside the review-round instruction it qualifies, so builders signal and mark ready while the engine requests reviewers (#574).
- `changelog.d/README.md` and `docs/CONSUMERS.md` now state the entry bound
  `changelog-armed` has always enforced: at most 300 characters, counted after
  continuation lines are joined and whitespace collapsed, so it bounds the
  whole entry and never one line of it (#571).
- The citation rule is stated as its admitted shape rather than as a
  prohibition: exactly one issue-citation group ends an entry, with the final
  `.` after it, and that group may carry several comma-separated references,
  cross-repo ones included. A second group anywhere is what fails (#571).
- The conversion checklist no longer reads as though deriving a filename were
  all an entry's own `#N` has to satisfy: a moved `## Unreleased` entry meets
  both entry rules too, and one citing several issues folds them into its
  single closing group (#571).
- Release closed issues' queue labels, assignees and attention in the sweep; pin bumps deliver the repair while triage covers older boards. (#549).
- The 24-hour ruling comment now asks the setter to re-read an issue-borne hard block instead of instructing withdrawn builder and triage picks; pull requests and timed issue defaults retain the full ladder (#537).
- The 7-day ruling nudge no longer counts the flag-setter's own comments as
  activity, so the party owing a published re-read can no longer silence the
  reminder addressed to the party owing the decision (#526, #534).
- The ruling clock now runs from the current `needs-ruling` `labeled` event
  instead of falling back to the item's creation date, so a long-open item
  flagged an hour ago is no longer reported as quiet for months (#534).
- The `operator` label description restores `or observation`, the string #508
  decided and the build dropped, so the row a consumer's board renders is no
  longer narrower than the `LABELS.md` and `TRIAGE.md` doctrine it summarizes
  (#508, #530).
- The five-round cap now lets a passing fifth round hand off and cuts only if a later push would open round six on that pull request (#523).
- The issue-flow reconciler no longer reports `reconciled.` over a board write
  it lost: each staged write's status is tested, the failing act is named
  without its comment body, and the pass summary counts the issues affected
  (#519).
- A lost board write still leaves the remaining staged effects applied and the
  hourly sweep green, so nothing is rolled back and one skipped issue still
  never reddens a run (#95, #101, #519).
- Require every top-level test and GitHub script to carry a scope mapping or an explicit unmapped declaration. (#518).
- The doors-unchanged instructions now list all seven release paths in script
  order, and the contract suite keeps that copy non-empty and byte-faithful to
  the script before a record author can rely on it (#514).

## 0.7.7 — 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- The `operator` core label's description measured 106 characters, over
  GitHub's 100-character cap, so `POST /labels` answered `422` and every fresh
  taxonomy bootstrap died on that row. It is reworded and unchanged in meaning
  (#508).
- `bootstrap_labels()` created labels in a loop with no per-row tolerance, so
  under `set -e` that one `422` aborted the run (#508).
- Every row after the failing one was therefore never attempted — including the
  consumer's whole `scope:*` set, which is appended after the core rows (#508).
- The loop now logs a failed row and continues, matching the contract the retire
  loop below it already had, and fails the run at the end with every missing row
  named in one line (#508).
- `test/labels-reconcile.test.sh` now asserts the cap across the whole core
  registry, so a future over-long row reds here rather than in a consumer's
  first bootstrap (#508).
- The label taxonomy bootstrap runs in its own `labels-sweep.yml` job under
  its own concurrency group, so an operator's `bootstrap=yes` press is no
  longer evicted from the sweep's shared queue and cancelled with no steps
  (#506, #503).
- The `reconcile` sweep keeps `group: labels-reconcile` and never
  bootstraps: it passes the literal `bootstrap: "no"`, and the gate that
  computed that value now decides whether the bootstrap job runs (#506).
- `actions/labels-reconcile` accepts `bootstrap_only`, off by default,
  which upserts the taxonomy and returns before reading the pull request
  list. No consumer caller, input or permission changes (#506).
- The bootstrap press now reports whether it survived the queue.
  `docs/CONSUMERS.md` told an operator to re-dispatch after a pin bump and
  stopped there, and `gh workflow run` prints the same confirmation whether
  the run executes or is evicted (#505, #503).
- Both documented run resolvers select the operator's own run by `actor.login`
  over the REST API. `--event workflow_dispatch` with `--limit 1` takes the
  trigger job's dispatch on any board with traffic, so the on-boarding block
  could report a false green (#505).
- A `cancelled` conclusion is stated to mean the taxonomy was not touched, and
  the retry sits beside the `core_label_rows()` hand-create for an operator who
  has lost several presses (#505).
- `### The pin-bump procedure` names the re-dispatch it owes and links the
  verification block; a grep of it for `bootstrap` returned nothing before
  (#505).
- The `missing core label(s)` warning no longer reads as "your pin is wrong" to
  an operator whose pin is right: it names queue eviction as a cause and points
  at the verified press (#505).
- The release-shape guard now says so on the pull request. Its `::warning::`
  attaches to the sweep's own check run on the default branch, so it reached no
  surface a builder, a reviewer or the merger reads: it fired 21 times over
  ceremony#500, which merged unlabelled and published nothing (#130, #501).
- That notice is posted once per episode and retracted when `release` arrives;
  a PR that loses and regains the label is told again. The annotation stays
  beside it, and the reconciler still never writes the label — notice is not a
  guess (#501).
- `docs/CONSUMERS.md` named no surface for that notice, which made its claim
  that the sweep says so first true of nothing a consumer could read (#501).

## 0.7.6 — 2026-08-24

### Added

- Let release callers declare a logged non-release tag namespace while the
  empty default keeps every unmatched tag failure unchanged (#497).
- Document the return path for doctrine: a consumer blocked by the vendored
  set raises a discussion here, in a four-part shape, and cites it where the
  local workaround lives. The generated `.ceremony/README.md` now names and
  links that flow (#492).
- Add an `operator` issue-owner label, owner-neutral ready semantics, and a
  quiet-work nudge for operator-owned issues (#491).
- Triage classifies every acceptance criterion at mint by who can produce its
  evidence, not only by when it can be checked. Evidence needing a surface a
  builder's session cannot reach is operator-owned, and says so, with its
  command and its wake condition, in its own text (#487).
- The drill record carries a sixth and last section, `## Known gaps` — coverage
  no probe drives at all, declared with a repeatable `--gap '<title>|<body>'`
  and rendered on every emission, with or without one (#484).
- A gap renders as `- **<title>** — <body>` and the parse cuts at the first
  `** — `, so a body may carry that sequence and a title may not — refused
  when the gap is declared and again when it is rendered (#484).
- `drill/rehearsal.sh --amend-record <path> --gap …` adds a gap to a committed
  record by re-rendering it: no probe, no scratch repo, no network call. It
  refuses a record that does not already round-trip (#484).

### Fixed

- `drill/**`, `test/drill-rehearsal.test.sh` and
  `.github/scripts/record-roundtrip.sh` derive `scope:release-flow`. The record
  was mapped from the start; the instrument that writes it was not (#484, #476).

## 0.7.5 — 2026-08-19

### Added

- Add independent release auto-merge and release-dispatch controls to the labels sweep (#468, #458, #464).
- Allow opted-in consumers to dispatch a release pinned to its merged commit, while keeping non-opted-in callers dry (ceremony#467, ceremony#458).
- A `post_merge_workflow` input on the labels sweep, empty by default. When set,
  a successful auto-merge dispatches that workflow, restoring the
  push-triggered run a `GITHUB_TOKEN` merge does not raise (#461, #458).
- The dispatch fires only after a merge that landed, goes through `run()` so
  `DRY_RUN=1` narrates it, and a failed dispatch is one log line naming the PR,
  the workflow and the reason — never a failed pass (#461).
- The auto-merge provenance comment now says when the same pass requested the
  human's review moments earlier, and omits the line when it did not (#461,
  #458).
- The labels reconciler now performs the merge its `auto_merge` verdict
  authorises: last in the pass, behind a confirmation read of the PR's state,
  head and `release` label, pinned to the graded head, and through `run()` so
  `DRY_RUN=1` narrates instead of merging (#460, #458).
- A merge GitHub refuses is logged on one line and never retried in the pass; a
  merge that lands posts one comment naming the head, the method, the toggle
  that authorised it and the `decide_state` verdict that triggered it (#460).
- Add an inert, opt-in auto-merge verdict with fleet-author and mergeability gates (#459, #458).

### Changed

- The consumer guide now gates fleet-worked repositories on a sourced minimum
  label set, a verified taxonomy bootstrap, and only then `repos.txt`
  registration, preventing partial claims on unprepared boards (#474, crew#459).
- Doctrine now states *"only humans merge"* conditionally: nine sites across
  `AGENTS.md`, `REVIEWER.md`, `LABELS.md`, `FLEET.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  name `auto_merge`, its `off` default and that it is the consumer's setting
  (#462, #458).
- `FLEET.md` keeps its identity invariant and gains the workflow token's own
  sentence beside it: no fleet identity gains a permission in this arc
  (#462, #458).
- `docs/CONSUMERS.md` gains the auto-merge operating manual — the two inputs,
  the two caller permissions, the five refusals, the push-run cost and the
  approval-latency note (#462, #458).
- The ceremony fleet roster now admits both builder identities to service
  builder-raised `rerun-owed` requests without changing either builder's
  review panel (#452, #424, #435).
- `docs/CONSUMERS.md` now states the board-shape tripwire set as the four
  families `0.7.4` ships, `stalled` included, with its three-term firing
  condition, its head-only placement, and how it reconciles with
  `blocker:ci-red` and `rerun-owed` (#448, #440, #441).

### Fixed

- `labels-reconcile` now marks the human review request it makes itself, with
  a hidden comment marker, and withdraws only what it marked once the round
  stops passing. A maintainer's request carries no mark and is never withdrawn
  (#479).
- A machine-made request no longer reads as a maintainer's deliberate early
  claim: a round with a required verdict missing lands on `state:addressing`
  with `blocker:unrequested` instead of telling the human a head nobody
  reviewed is theirs to merge (#479).
- Map changes to the fleet doctrine file to the documentation scope (#476).
- `labels-reconcile` now bootstraps the taxonomy only when the caller asks
  for it. `bootstrap=no` was unobeyable: the gate read the event name, and
  every trigger-woken sweep is a `workflow_dispatch` (#472, #466).
- A ceremony pin bump that adds a core label no longer installs it on the
  next board event. Dispatch the sweep caller, as `docs/CONSUMERS.md` says;
  the scheduled sweep warns until you do (#472, #466).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s roster now agrees with `panel=`: the departed
  `grok-bot-andresmgsl` row is gone, and the panel rule names no verdict
  count — the required set is the review bench minus the PR's author, with
  which rows are the bench made explicit so triage is not read into it
  (#456).
- `ci-rerun`'s fleet roster now names each identity once, in the order the
  conf names it: `load_fleet` dedups on append, so a repo whose per-author
  `panel[<login>]=` rows repeat its `panel=` reviewers reads a clean list in
  the gate-1 refusal comment. Admission is unchanged (#453, #424).

## 0.7.4 — 2026-08-16

### Added

- The issue-flow sweep flags a **stalled chain head**: a blocker chain three or
  more issues deep, counting the head, whose `claimed` head has a red open PR.
  Comment-only, on the head alone, naming the remedy — service the red, or
  re-order the chain (#440, #426).
- `lib/checks.sh` — the rollup classifier both reconcilers now source, so the
  tripwire grades a head with the same instrument that decides
  `blocker:ci-red` and the two can never disagree (#440, #136, #139, #208).
- Flag idle queues, deeply serial blocker chains, and dependency cycles from the issue-flow sweep's existing board snapshot (#426).
- Triage now puts measured flow-wide breakage at the front of a collision
  chain while ordinary work keeps arrival order (#425).
- Front-row insertion records its evidence and edge direction, preserves a
  claimed issue's labels, and orders overlapping work at merge (#425).
- `actions/ci-rerun`: a base-repo workflow that services `rerun-owed` by
  starting the rerun a fork PR's author cannot. Its job holds `actions: write`
  for one run, checks out nothing from the head, and runs no PR-authored code
  (#424).
- Four gates, all measured at service time and none inherited from the label:
  the actor is a fleet identity in `.github/labels.conf`, the head still is the
  one the evidence names, the run concluded `failure`, and it is on attempt 1
  (#424).
- A started rerun removes `rerun-owed` and comments the new attempt's URL; a
  refusal leaves the label standing and comments which gate refused and what a
  human would have to do. There is no schedule and no retry — the workflow acts
  on one label event and stops (#424).
- Consumers get the servicing at their next pin bump: `docs/CONSUMERS.md`
  carries the caller stub and the `permissions` block, without which the
  workflow refuses every time (#424).
- Only a run created before the evidence comment that names the head is a
  rerun candidate: a `pull_request_target` run carries the head's SHA, so the
  workflows the label event itself wakes are in that list too and must never
  be rerun in the red run's place (#424).
- `rerun-owed`: a PR-only label for a head that is red on a rerun no agent may
  start. The builder sets it with evidence opening `🔁 rerun owed at head
  <sha>`; the reconciler clears it when that head's checks leave failing, or
  when the named head is no longer the head (#423).
- While `rerun-owed` stands at a head, `blocker:ci-red` is not asserted there:
  that label says the builder owes a fix, and on a fork PR's base-repo run the
  builder owes nothing. It is not a blocker and never enters the set (#423).
- A sixth park shape: a red head whose rerun is a right the builder does not
  hold parks the claim and frees the build slot. Every other red head is still
  the builder's, and the `ci-red` wake skips the labelled one (#423).
- `rerun-owed` is not exempt from the 48-hour staleness clock: a head standing
  under it still goes `stale`, and that `stale` asks for a poke of whoever
  services the rerun, never a fix from the builder. A flag earns an exemption
  only by carrying an escalation clock of its own (#423).

### Changed

- Document the issue-flow sweep's comment-only idle, deep-chain and cycle
  tripwires, including placement, shape-keyed deduplication and shared
  threshold ownership (#441).
- The `ci-rerun` roster precondition in `docs/CONSUMERS.md` drops its census
  of the governed repositories' `.github/labels.conf` files, which was false:
  identities that build as well as review are named in the roster the gate
  reads (#437).
- In its place the paragraph gives a directive the reader runs against their
  own conf — the three fields gate 1 reads — rather than a measurement of
  other repositories that nothing re-checks when a roster changes (#437).
- The one-build-at-a-time slot is stated as the builder's own, across every
  repository they work in: the self-check is whether an unparked claim is
  held anywhere, never whether the board in front of you is clean (#430).
- The slot sentence stops carrying a second test for when a build ends. A
  claim holds the slot until it is parked or released, so the park list is
  the only definition of finishing and the two can no longer disagree (#430).
- The claim comment now asserts the slot: no unparked claim in any
  repository, naming any parked claims held elsewhere with their shape
  (#430).
- `AGENTS.md`'s router row now sends the builder to an ordered chain of PRs,
  normally one — the fourth surface of the singular arithmetic, and the one
  the mint's regex could not see behind its backticked `ready` (#420, #429).
- One issue now means an ordered chain of PRs, normally one. A PR carries at
  most five rounds; at the close of round 5 the builder continues the branch
  in a successor PR and the predecessor closes as the ledger (#420).
- The cap is a consensus-surface rule and not a byte defence: the longer a PR
  runs, the harder it is to bring the whole panel onto one head (#417, #420).
- A cut spends every approval. The review target becomes the successor, no
  verdict is owed on the closed predecessor, and rounds are numbered per PR
  so the successor's first round is round 1 (#420).
- The issue gains a triage-maintained `## Pull requests` list in chain order,
  present only once a chain exists and triggered by the builder's cut
  comment; it is the only place a chain stays navigable (#420).
- Triage now sizes accepted work for bounded review rounds and splits oversized work into ideally disjoint epic children, treating later round growth as evidence for the next mint (#419).
- The PR body's `## Round log` is a rolling summary rather than a verbatim
  mirror of each round's reply: `### Current state` is rewritten every
  round, `### Rounds` gains one row of facts plus two prose cells, and
  handoff waits on those cells being filled (#418).
- A round's reply shrinks to a short comment naming the round and the head,
  so the comment thread stops growing with the body it used to duplicate
  (#418).

## 0.7.3 — 2026-08-15

### Changed

- Made vendored review and release doctrine self-contained by replacing cross-repository references with local records. (#408).

### Fixed

- Every early-exiting reader in `lib/changelog.sh` and the two label
  actions is fed from a variable instead of a pipe. A reader that exits
  early left its writer taking `EPIPE`, so `pipefail` failed the pipeline
  although the reader had succeeded (#364, #411).
- `changelog-armed` no longer fabricates a changelog shape violation
  against a repository whose published section is large, and no longer
  passes a real one in silence (#411).
- A scope label whose glob matches early in a large PR's changed-file
  list is applied instead of silently dropped (#411).

## 0.7.2 — 2026-08-13

### Added

- Add a guard that rejects unpinned third-party actions and reusable workflows (#399).
- `runner-isolated` takes `pr-code-runner-labels`: the runner labels a
  consumer asserts PR-authored code may execute on. Empty by default, so a
  caller passing nothing keeps the verdict it had on every file that
  executes PR code; the axis correction above is what moves the rest
  (#395).

### Changed

- Pin checkout references to v4.4.0, including the refs-guard.yml upgrade from v4.2.2 (#399).
- `docs-sync` names the fault it saw: a 404 asks about the pin, a 5xx says
  the pin is fine and the failure is transient, a connection failure claims
  nothing about the ref, and an archive that will not unpack says so (#393).
- Refuse a taken explicit drill fork ref before creating a scratch repository, and print a runnable retry using the first free paired attempt (#387).

### Fixed

- `runner-isolated` reads `runs-on:` in its block-mapping form: a
  `labels:` key one level in is the runner spec's label set, in both of
  its spellings — a value beside the key, or a sequence beneath it
  (#402).
- A `pull_request` file naming a self-hosted tier that way passed with an
  empty allowlist and now fails. Vouch for the tier in
  `pr-code-runner-labels`, or split the workflow (#402).
- `runner-isolated` leaves a `runs-on:` mapping's other keys inert, so a
  `group:` above or below the `labels:` neither contributes a label nor
  closes the window. A group named `self-hosted` with no `labels:` key
  still passes: a group name is not a label (#402, #395).
- `runner-isolated` asks whether a file executes PR-authored code, not
  whether it is PR-triggered: a `pull_request_target` file that checks out a
  PR ref now fails, and one that checks out none passes however it is
  routed (#395).

- `runner-isolated` reads a self-hosted label passed through a `with:` input,
  the shape a reusable-workflow caller uses, so a label named there is judged
  exactly as one named in `runs-on:` (#395).

- A label is read in whatever spelling it is written — quoted, flow, block
  scalar, a flow collection opening on the line after its key, or an alias to
  an anchor the same file defines — in a `with:` input and in `runs-on:`
  alike (#395).

- A value written on the line after its key is read when it is a scalar as
  well: a wrapped `'["self-hosted","ci-runner"]'` names its labels. A
  `*name` inside a quoted scalar stays that scalar's text (#395).

- A label opening with a dash is read whole, so `-self-hosted` and a quoted
  `"- pr-runner"` are vouched for by those exact strings; only a `- ` YAML
  uses as a sequence indicator is punctuation (#395).
- `docs-sync` retries the doctrine tarball (four attempts over ~15 s) and
  downloads it to a file before extracting, so a transient 503 from GitHub's
  archive endpoint no longer reds a consumer's required check (#393).

## 0.7.1 — 2026-08-12

### Added

- Let reusable labels, labels-sweep, and release callers route every job to a JSON-encoded hosted label or self-hosted label set (#383).
- Grade the drill record by re-render: CI parses a bare-version tree's record back into the inputs that would render it and requires the bytes back, so a hand-edited record fails where a shape check passed it (#313, #373).

### Changed

- `BUILDER.md` tells a builder whose handoff was taken back to clear the
  blocker rather than re-set the label, the stop condition the "optimistic
  write" sentence left out (#377).
- Make release-drill scratch repositories public by default, with an explicit private mode and records based on observed visibility (#372).
- Number rehearsal scratch attempts and route default names around archived leftovers without reclaiming repositories or refs (#371).

### Fixed

- The reconciler says why it took a handoff back: a PR carrying
  `state:needs-human` that degrades to `state:addressing` because a
  `blocker:*` stands now gets one PR comment naming the take-back, the exact
  blockers standing, and the precondition (#377).
- That comment is marked with the blocker set and the head SHA, so a sweep
  posts it once per episode — a new head or a changed blocker set earns one
  new comment, the same head with the same blockers never a second (#377).
- It speaks only for a take-back that landed: a label edit that failed, or one
  skipped because the repo has no `state:addressing`, leaves the handoff
  standing and says nothing — and marks no episode, so the pass where the edit
  does land still speaks (#377).
- The other three ways `state:needs-human` degrades — a draft, a pending
  ruling, a directed hold — stay silent, each already carrying a visible
  label that says why (#377).
- Make drill probes fail on unread fragment, release, or branch data instead of scoring an answer no read established (#375).
- Setup aborts now emit separate, non-releasable evidence records and archive any scratch repository they created (#370).
- The drill instrument retries every read it makes after a write, bounded by
  `DRILL_READ_TRIES` and `DRILL_READ_NAP_SECONDS`, so a stale or transient
  answer from GitHub no longer aborts the setup (#369).
- A drill read that never answers says so — naming the read, its target and
  the attempt count — instead of asserting that the write it followed failed
  (#369).
- `drill_gh_soft` tells an absent answer from a failed one: a 404 is still
  exit 0 and empty, and anything else is non-zero for the caller to retry or
  abort on (#369).
- A drill record no longer states what a read said when the read never
  answered: the re-arm rows, the changelog comparisons and the label
  confirmation before a merge each report the unread read instead of a claim
  about the repository derived from it (#369).
- A drill setup no longer writes on a read that never answered: an existence
  read that fails to the end of its budget aborts the commit rather than
  reading as "this repository is empty" and sending the bootstrap write to a
  branch that already has a head (#369).
- A candidate verification that read no workflow file refuses instead of
  reporting the candidate SHA as verified — a verification that took no
  measurement is not a verification (#369).
- A disposal whose flag reads back `archived: false` for the whole retry
  budget is recorded as an archive that did not land, distinctly from a read
  that never answered at all — the first is a measurement, the second is the
  absence of one (#369).

## 0.7.0 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- The release drill rehearses the rc legs: an rc cut probe asserting a
  prerelease, an untouched `CHANGELOG.md` and surviving fragments, and a
  promotion probe asserting the assembled final section while the candidate
  stays a prerelease (#321).
- `drill/rehearsal.sh` runs the release drill: scratch repo, armed fixture,
  caller stub at a rewritten fork pin, the six doctrine probes and the
  record. Every refusal probe's nothing-created claim is a before/after tag
  and release count (#313).
- The instrument archives and never deletes, printing the operator's delete
  step instead of retrying a 403 wall, and refuses to pin the caller stub at
  a tag-named ref on this repo (#135, #313).

### Changed

- Release-init step 1 now covers the member that arrives by re-opening a
  closed issue: re-point its declaration at the epic and verify the parse
  before the re-open, so the sweep cannot promote it in between (#325).
- Release doctrine now covers cumulative prerelease cuts, deterministic rc
  re-arming, and the changelog precondition for adopting that path (#322).
- Release doors now publish candidates as prereleases with fragment-assembled notes and automatically re-arm the next candidate (#320).
- Changelog guards now preserve fragments and leave the changelog untouched for tag-only release candidates (#319).
- Release candidates now re-arm deterministically to the next numbered rc development tree (#318).

### Fixed

- The issue-flow sweep survives a long release body: the membership record
  reaches its parser from a variable rather than a pipe, so the parser's
  bounding `exit` can no longer break the writer feeding it (#364).
- A pre-loop failure in that sweep names its stage — the board read, the
  membership parse, or the flag computation — instead of a bare `jq`
  message and an exit code (#364).
- Make the closing-issue graph authoritative for `Refs` pull requests and stop treating quoted closing keywords in code spans as defects (#359).
- The epic task-list parse takes every CommonMark list marker, not just
  `-` and `*`; rows and headings indented past three spaces open nothing
  (#349).
- Neither section parser reads a heading or a row inside a fenced code
  block, and an indented heading now closes its section instead of running
  the parse into the next one (#349).
- Skip an issue when its dependency state cannot be read instead of accusing a valid blocker declaration (#345).

## 0.6.3 — 2026-08-08

### Changed

- A release issue records its window membership under a `## Members` heading, read by heading and one bare `#N` per row; its `Blocked by` line answers the predecessor gate and nothing else (#343).
- The standing-window decision and the non-member flag read that record, with no fallback to the gate: a release issue that enumerates no membership stands no window and draws no flag (#343).

### Fixed

- Prevent release-window carriers from joining their own gates and suppress stale board-flag claims after an issue pass changes queue state (#327).

## 0.6.2 — 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- `BUILDER.md` gives the parked-claim shapes the ordering they were missing:
  an operator-owned remainder parks the claim and never the handoff, so the
  state finishing the work puts you in cannot excuse the handoff it should
  follow (#336).
- A session does not block on a producer it cannot prove alive — where a job
  signals its own completion, that signal is the wake and the finished
  output is read afterwards (#336).

## 0.6.1 — 2026-08-06

### Changed

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` no longer enumerates the vendored set: both the doctrine
  convention's scope and the consumption section name and link
  `docs/VENDORED.txt`, so a seventh vendored doc is one edit to the manifest
  and the convention reaches it (#316).
- The two-consumption-modes framing in "How the other repos use this" is
  compressed to a lead that routes to the README, which now states it in
  full; the governed-repo list and the one-pin paragraph stay (#316, #311).

### Fixed

- `BUILDER.md` scopes the green-check precondition to the act it governs:
  where an engine mediates the request, declaring a round answered is not
  requesting the panel, so the declaration goes out as soon as the round's
  fixes are pushed (#330).
- The reason is stated where a builder reads it: the engine already holds
  the request while a head is pending or red, so an early declaration
  cannot produce an early request, while a withheld one is priced as
  silence (#330).
- `RELEASES.md` states what happens when a gate member lands `post-merge`
  with successors declaring on it: triage splits the remainder onto a fresh
  issue and closes the original on what it delivered (#329).
- The release edge is named — the original's close, never the remainder's,
  since each successor's declaration keys to the original's number (#329).
- The trigger is a check rather than a judgement, the blocker parse over
  open `blocked` bodies, and the picked-up exception keeps a claimed issue
  from being closed out from under its builder (#329).
- The rejected alternative is recorded with its three reasons, so teaching
  the blocker parse to count `post-merge` as landed is not re-proposed as an
  obvious simplification (#329).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-08-05

### Added

- The issue-flow sweep's `claimed`-branch ruling pre-read is pinned: an
  unassigned claim under `needs-ruling` must draw its board diagnostic and
  its ruling nudge in one sweep, so a read that drifts below the diagnostic
  reds instead of silently costing the escalation 7 days (#284, #307).
- The issue-flow sweep now flags a collision the board never declared: two
  open, unblocked issues whose titles name one deliverable draw a comment
  naming the newer's owed `Blocked by` edge. Keys normalize, so
  `actions/x` and `x` are one deliverable (#288).
- The sweep now flags an unblocked non-member during a standing release
  window, naming the window's invariant. `claimed` counts, PR in flight or
  not. The gate is read from the release issue's own `Blocked by`
  declarations, and an emptied gate leaves it dormant (#292).
- Both flags are advisory: comments only, no label write and no state
  change, deduped against each family's last word on the thread so a
  standing state re-sweeps silently (#293).
- The fragment guard now requires each entry to end with its issue
  citation: one `(#N)` group — local, `repo#N` or `owner/repo#N`
  references separated by `, ` — then the final `.` and nothing after it
  (#262).
- The refusal distinguishes an entry carrying no reference at all from one
  whose reference is present but not terminal, and names the shape to
  write in both (#262).
- The 300-character bound still outranks the citation across the whole
  fragment, and the outranked problem stays out of the message it lost
  to: one fragment, one diagnosis, wherever in the file it sits (#262).
- BUILDER.md now describes a fix round that rides a draft: the draft phase
  stays the builder's, ready-for-review is the builder's own act, and where a
  draft suppressed the checks green is proven at the flip (#258).
- REVIEWER.md now reads a draft carrying `state:addressing` as a fix round in
  progress rather than abandonment (#258).
- A `post-merge` item with no comment for 7 days now draws one nudge from the
  issue sweep: the wake evidence is owed. A starving criterion used to be
  found only when someone happened to run the right read (#254).
- Label churn does not reset that clock, and neither does an assignment: on
  `post-merge` an assignee is an invalid composition, not activity, and it
  must not buy the item another 7 days of silence (#254).
- The nudge names the triage actor from `triage-actors=`, not the human
  reviewer: `post-merge` is triage's completion queue, so the starved wake
  condition is triage's to answer (#254).
- It links the item and parses nothing from the body — which criterion
  starved is prose, and the machine never judges prose (#254).
- Like the ruling nudge it carries no idempotency marker on purpose: the
  comment is itself activity, so the rule self-rate-limits to one nudge per 7
  quiet days. Comment-only — no path here writes a label (#254).
- Release epics now announce release initialization when their declared dependency gates clear (#253).
- The issue sweep now echoes an issue's parsed `Blocked by` set as a comment
  whenever that set changes, so a readable-but-wrong declaration is visible in
  one sweep instead of days later, when a human happens to run the parser by
  hand (#252).
- The echo's marker carries the parsed set itself: an unchanged parse never
  re-posts on a 15-minute cron, and a changed one always speaks. Comment-only
  — no path here writes a label (#252).
- CI now refuses a root `*.md` declared in neither `docs/VENDORED.txt` nor the
  guard's short exemption list, so a new doctrine file can no longer reach a
  tag undeclared and stay invisible to every consumer's `docs-sync` (#251).
- The same guard reads the manifest the other way: every entry must resolve to
  a regular, non-empty, tracked file — no symlink, no directory, no `../`
  escape (#251).
- Document the optional, operator-ruled release-epic flow for governed repositories. (#248).
- Guard documentation availability markers against missing issue citations
  and release candidates that already ship the cited work (#238).
- The label and issue-flow sweeps now comment once per episode when
  `attention` targets a pull request or an unassigned issue, without
  retargeting the demand or changing labels or assignees (#232).
- Pull requests that promise `Refs #N` now fail a read-only, body-edit-aware
  guard if GitHub would close N through a keyword or sidebar link (#218).

### Changed

- `README.md` is rewritten whole from the current tree: the front page names
  the governance repo ceremony now is, routes to `docs/CONSUMERS.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `LABELS.md` and `RELEASES.md` rather than restating them, and
  keeps the operator's release runbook as its core, re-measured (#311).
- Standing release windows are dependency DAGs: every mint is placed in the window or behind it, and only current sources are `ready` (#292).
- TRIAGE.md now requires unconditional collision-edge chains when open issues
  carry the same deliverable, keeping the ready queue concurrently claimable
  (#288).
- TRIAGE.md now states its rules with bare record cites: the label-race and
  lifted-hold incident narratives leave the normative text while their
  operational rules remain complete (#282).
- `BUILDER.md` states its rules and cites their record bare: the incident
  narratives, the links into issue comments and the cross-repo issue cites
  leave the normative text, which no rule leaves with them (#281).
- CONTRIBUTING.md now keeps vendored doctrine self-contained: state the rule,
  retain at most one sentence of why, cite the local record bare, and leave the
  incident narrative in that record (#280).
- BUILDER.md's green ruled term now says which entry to read before it says
  what an entry means: a check's word at a head is its newest entry by start
  time, and a cancelled entry is not that word while the same check carries a
  non-cancelled one at that head (#276).
- A check whose every entry at the head is cancelled is unchanged — nothing
  survived to be its word, so it never reported and is not green — and the
  collapse mirrors `checks_state`'s carve-out rather than adding a class
  (#276).
- BUILDER.md's step 1 now rules the checkless head: no checks configured is
  nothing to wait for, and the request goes out straight away — stated once,
  in the ruled-term paragraph, with the draft-round restatement removed
  (#272).
- `README.md` and `RELEASES.md` derive `scope:docs`, and the
  `changelog-assembled`, `docs-sync` and `runner-isolated` actions and tests
  derive `scope:guards`; all five were mapped nowhere. The docs block matched
  a literal `README`, which this tree does not carry (#267).
- `lib/read.sh` and `lib/ruling.sh` derive `scope:labels` beside
  `scope:release-flow`. Both reconcilers share them, and a mixed file wears
  both labels rather than `lib/**` being re-carved into a row per file (#267).
- TRIAGE.md now tells every epic author to put its progress checklist under
  the literal `## Task list` heading, because any other heading is silently
  invisible to the completion sweep (#266).
- TRIAGE.md now scopes the no-assignee board bug to flagging an unassigned
  issue, while still directing triage to repair ownership instead (#264).
- `BUILDER.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` state the citation as guard-enforced
  rather than as house style, beside the 300-character bound it now sits
  next to (#262).
- Four fragments in flight gained a terminal citation; published sections
  are untouched, so no shipped prose is re-opened (#262).
- BUILDER.md's green ruled term now names its field: greenness is read from
  each check's `conclusion`, never its `status`, and *stale* means a check
  of a superseded head — not a same-head node whose `status` lags its own
  conclusion (#260).
- Consumer guidance: re-vendor tooling reads the pin's `docs/VENDORED.txt`,
  never a hardcoded list, so a new doctrine file propagates at the next
  ordinary pin bump with zero list edits (#251).
- Define the doors-unchanged drill record and an executable release-path list,
  so a release may reuse live evidence only when its door bytes are unchanged
  since the last rehearsed tag (#237).

### Fixed

- A roster edit no longer reds the whole suite: the labels-reconcile
  state-machine fixtures name their own panel instead of binding
  `.github/labels.conf` by slot (#304).
- Shrinking `panel=` to three had left that binding's third slot unbound, and
  `set -u` aborted the file before its first assertion — 217 assertions
  became 0, on `main` and on every branch cut from it (#304).
- The one case still reading the shipped roster asserts a property, not a
  size: it parses, and each member is recused from its own panel. Any
  `panel=` of one or more members leaves `test/run.sh` green (#304).
- `lib/attention.sh` locates as label machinery beside its two shelf-mates —
  `[scope:release-flow]` alone was a wrong answer of the class #267 measured
  — and the map learns the sweep workflow pair, the shared-lib tests, and
  seven enumerated test/guard surfaces (#302).
- Claiming a `needs-ruling` issue no longer buys its escalation another 7
  quiet days: the issue-side ruling clock reads comments alone — an
  assignment is the claim clock's fact — and LABELS.md now names what each
  surface's clock reads (#284).
- `scope:release-flow` no longer rides every pull request: `changelog.d/**`
  is out of its path map. Doctrine makes every behavior change write a
  fragment, so the glob labelled 20 of the last 20 PRs while 3 touched a
  release surface. `CHANGELOG.md` stays, as only the release PR edits it
  (#267).
- The issue-flow reconciler and its test now derive `scope:labels`, the scope
  that already names the taxonomy they reconcile (#267).
- Abort issue-flow reconciliation when the board read fails instead of reporting a complete pass over an empty or partial result (#257).
- The issue sweep no longer derives label writes from a read that failed. An
  HTTP 504 whose body is GitHub's JSON error object passed every guard and
  emptied the label set, so a healthy epic was written `needs-triage` and the
  pass reported success (#247).
- A failed comments read no longer reclaims a live claim. Swallowed, it dated
  the issue by `created_at` and unassigned the builder under a comment
  asserting 48 hours of silence about an issue commented on seconds earlier
  (#247).
- A failed comments read no longer reads as "no marker", which re-posted the
  comment the marker exists to suppress (#247).
- Every read inside the per-issue subshell is checked explicitly, on its
  status and on its payload shape; the issue is left exactly as it is and the
  sweep continues. A partial pass names its skipped issues after
  `reconciled.` (#247).
- A per-issue pass is now atomic: its writes and its log lines commit only
  once the pass completes. A skip could previously land after an earlier
  mutation, reporting an issue as untouched when a label had already been
  written or removed (#247).
- The issue-flow sweep now reads an issue's deliverable as the `Refs` PR that
  merged last, not the one numbered highest — merge order is not number order,
  and the old rule spent the transition marker on the wrong PR (#242).
- Preserve active claims when an open local pull request links them with `Refs #N`. (#241).
- `blocker:unrequested` no longer fires while a head's checks are pending or
  red: the review round forbids requesting there, so the one blocker that
  demanded an act flagged builders for complying. Pending is CI's move, red is
  `blocker:ci-red`'s (#236).
- `blocker:unrequested` now waits for the round to settle — the head and the
  newest verdict must have stood for `RECONCILE_UNREQUESTED_GRACE` (default
  300s) — so a sweep landing between a push and its re-request no longer flags
  a round in motion (#236).
- LABELS.md no longer claims nothing in `actions/` clears or reads
  `attention`: the reconciler has done both since the derived `claimed` →
  `post-merge` transition shipped. The amended text keeps the hand-set rule
  and admits the one clear and the diagnostic read (#231).
- Triage now puts `attention` on the assigned issue that owns a claim, never
  on its pull request, and treats an unassigned issue as a board bug rather
  than a demand (#230).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- `labels.conf` accepts optional `panel[<login>]=` rows: the required set for
  a PR authored by that login is the row minus the author; other authors keep
  `panel=`. Consumers gain the row at their next pin bump — adding it before
  that bump is a parse failure that takes the label board down (#224).

### Changed

- Doctrine: third-party actions never hold a write-capable token by default —
  repo-owned scripts in write-capable jobs, established publisher plus
  full-SHA pin for the exception, SHA pins everywhere. Canonical in
  REVIEWER.md, short form in BUILDER.md; consumers adopt at the pin bump
  (#216).

### Fixed

- `ruling_escalation_row` selects the setter's best-shaped in-window comment,
  ties broken to the earliest, instead of the earliest outright — a whole-round
  reply landing seconds before the escalation is no longer graded in its place
  (crew#293).
- The escalation selector and `ruling_shape_decision` share one field-presence
  matcher, and an undecodable body column scores 0 instead of erroring the
  sweep.
- Five stale **unreleased** markers in `docs/CONSUMERS.md` now name their
  tags: fragment mode, `changelog-assembled` and `runner-isolated` at
  `0.2.0`; the additive labeler at `0.3.0`; the two-caller split at `0.4.1`
  (#221).
- The marker convention now names its clearing owner: the release PR that
  ships machinery clears, in that same PR, every marker its assembled
  section makes false (#221).
- A standing non-approving verdict now outranks draft in `decide_state`: a
  re-drafted PR mid-round reads `state:addressing`, a live panel request on a
  draft surfaces as `state:bots-reviewing`, and a draft with no round history
  still reads `state:building` (#205).

## 0.4.1 — 2026-08-01

### Changed

- The reconcile sweep is detached from PR-triggered runs: a new reusable
  `labels-sweep.yml` carries it, woken by `labels.yml`'s new `trigger` job, so
  a queue-displaced sweep cancels on the Actions tab instead of landing a
  cancelled `reconcile` check on a PR (#209).
- Labels consumers add a sweep caller (`labels-sweep.yml`, stub in
  docs/CONSUMERS.md), relocate the hourly cron and manual bootstrap dispatch
  to it, and grant the labels caller `actions: write`; a pin bump without the
  sweep caller goes loudly red at the trigger job (#209).

### Fixed

- `checks_state` drops rollup entries belonging to the workflow it runs
  inside — `SELF_WORKFLOW`, defaulting to the ambient `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` —
  before the newest-per-context collapse: the label machine never grades
  its own runs, and an empty name filters nothing (#208).
- A sweep displaced from the shared concurrency queue attaches CANCELLED to
  its PR while its successor attaches elsewhere, so the sweep set
  `blocker:ci-red` off its own displaced run and re-affirmed it every
  cadence (crew#227). A rollup of only self entries now honestly scores
  NONE (#208).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-29

### Added

- `changelog.d/shape` — an optional one-line sentinel, `flat` or `grouped`,
  that pins the fragment set's shape and outranks the newest-published-section
  inference; absent, the inference binds unchanged (#182).
- Add `post-merge` issue state for merged `Refs` work awaiting triage-owned verification.
- `changelog_fragment_problem` bounds every entry at 300 normalized
  characters, red on the PR that writes the fragment; the armed guard and
  the assembler inherit the one definition (#167).
- BUILDER.md and CHANGELOG.md state the bound and the split rule: a long
  change ships several short entries, never one long one (#167).

### Changed

- Labels automation docs now make sweep cadence a consumer-owned tradeoff,
  retain hourly as the engine-less default, and document manual dispatch as
  the operator's immediate full-board sweep (#203).
- `labels` — the reconcile cron relaxes from `*/15` to hourly (#199), cutting a
  private consumer's schedule-triggered full-board sweeps ~4× at GitHub's
  1-minute billing floor.
- `labels` — the hourly cron is the sweep's only wake for transitions no
  subscribed event carries — a verdict landing, blocker:ci-red, a
  blocker:conflict when another PR merges, the time-based stale/reclaim — so it
  bounds their latency to ≤1h, delaying no event-carried transition (#199).
- `labels` — the caller's `issues:` trigger narrows to
  `[opened, closed, edited, reopened]` (#199), the actions that carry a
  queue-state change the cron cannot wait a cadence for. The churn/validation
  actions — labeled/unlabeled/assigned/unassigned — come off; the PR handoff
  wake is unaffected.
- `labels` — each caller trigger now carries a comment saying why it is
  subscribed, and reconcile keeps `cancel-in-progress: false` (#199) —
  cancelling a sweep mid-board is the race that guard exists to prevent.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` now points to `BUILDER.md` for the shared PR flow instead
  of restating doctrine that can drift, while retaining ceremony's roster and
  other repo-specific facts (#198).
- Builder doctrine makes each whole-round reply the durable Round log record
  mirrored by the engine, leaving handoff as a mechanical facts-only step
  instead of a newly composed summary (#196).
- `FLEET.md` removes its duplicate bench roster, records crew as a general
  operator-configured tool, and advances its whole-file audit stamp to
  `crew@eaeb302` with every surviving crew link re-pinned (#193).
- `FLEET.md` keeps the registry's authorization rule and its crew#16/crew#66
  provenance, while replacing duplicated mechanism and path claims with a
  pinned pointer to crew's registry header (#192).
- `BUILDER.md` gates both review-request points on a green check at the
  head, carries crew#45's argued exception for failures outside the PR,
  and states the ruled classification: cancelled and stale are not a
  green head; skipped and neutral are (#189).
- `BUILDER.md` documents CI-red recovery in pickup precedence: a red head
  of your own PR is picked up before claiming another issue, is never a
  parked claim, and follows crew#17's recovery path (#189).
- `FLEET.md` writes the ci-red wake into the duty order between resume
  and build, now as deployed engine rather than on paper: the
  reconciliation stamp advances to the crew SHA carrying crew#64 (#189).
- `FLEET.md` describes the build wake's check gate as the engine
  implements it: a green head, or one with no checks configured, opens a
  round; a red head and an unfinished one are held and reported
  separately (#189).
- `FLEET.md` corrects the attention wake to the crew#66 ruling: the query
  is cross-repo, the action is registry-bounded, and an out-of-scope
  demand is reported and escalated to the operator rather than worked. It
  no longer claims attention is exempt from the registry (#189).
- `FLEET.md` distinguishes an attention session that dies before acking,
  which relaunches, from one that completes without acking, which is a
  decline a ledger keeps from re-firing (#189).
- `BUILDER.md` re-requests by head, not by verdict: a push while
  answering a round stales every approval, so every panelist is
  re-requested; only an unchanged head re-requests the non-approvers
  alone (#190).
- FLEET.md's duty-loop mechanism is a pointer to crew's shared engine; the
  wake lists follow the engine's duty order, the roster keeps the as-built
  bench beside `fleet.roster`'s target, and the reconciliation stamp names
  crew@`01fb49c` (#187).
- Ceremony's changelog is grouped from this release forward: the pending
  fragments carry `### ` headings under a `grouped` sentinel (#182).
- BUILDER.md: a park declaration stands until its facts change — a
  nothing-changed resumption posts nothing; only a no-open-PR park owes a
  refresh, inside the 48-hour reclaim window (#178).
- Private-repository label callers document `actions: read` alongside checks and statuses for workflow-run check-rollup nodes (#173).

### Fixed

- FLEET.md no longer says a review request outside the registry is
  authorization: `repos.txt` is the scope for the review queue, out-of-scope
  requests are logged and never acted on, and the attention wake is stated
  as the one registry-independent exception, by design (#187).
- `blocked_reference_records` unions every `Blocked by` clause in the body
  instead of binding to the first marker occurrence — a repeated declaration
  no longer promotes on its first sentence alone, and earlier prose that
  merely mentions being blocked no longer hijacks the parse (#184).
- `decide_state()` refuses `state:needs-human` while the hand-set `blocked`
  label stands — the PR falls to `state:addressing`, exactly parallel to the
  `needs-ruling` exclusion; never emitted by `blockers()` (#180).

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-24

- Make `changelog-armed` reject fragment shape drift on the PR that introduces it.
- A directive hold now has a written ending, not just a beginning: BUILDER.md's shape 5 says the hold ends where it began — on the labels — with the hold owner's most recent queue-label event governing over any stale prose, the timeline read (`gh api .../issues/{n}/timeline`) named as the move before standing down or up on a hold, a claim against stale prose required to cite the events it read, and a refused claim given its two exits. TRIAGE.md now requires re-reading label events before asserting label-borne state in prose, and makes correcting a lifted hold's stale body header triage's move in the same tick. On 2026-07-24 the unranked signals split two builders reading one board (#149, #151); both acted defensibly — the doctrine, not the builders, lacked the rule (#154).
- Doctrine names the second `Closes #N` exception: a same-repo PR whose
  authorizing issue marks an acceptance criterion post-merge uses `Refs #N`,
  and triage closes the issue by hand on the evidence — merging #143
  auto-closed #137 with exactly such a criterion unmet, and no role had been
  told otherwise. TRIAGE.md now requires a post-merge criterion to carry its
  own mechanism (post-merge, triage closes, `Refs #N`), REVIEWER.md lists
  `Refs #N` beside `Closes #N` and `Part of <owner>/<repo>#N` and stops
  treating the reference-only PR as a defect, and CONTRIBUTING.md points at
  BUILDER.md as the rule's one home (#151).
- FLEET.md — the Reviewers wake describes the deployed sweep, not the `gh search` trigger the bench replaced: the pulls-API `requested_reviewers` sweep across the org plus the named bot forks is source 1, the `repos.txt`/search poll an adds-only backstop, and the two are merged and deduplicated by (repo, PR) before acting. Only the notifier's `needs-ruling` queue remains on paper; `repos.txt` is the registry only on the triage box; and the Status block now stamps the crew ref the file was last reconciled against (#149).
- REVIEWER.md now carries the review mechanics every box had been re-deriving from an incident: the queue comes from the API and not the search index, every write is one-shot per (reviewer, PR, head), heads are reviewed in throwaway checkouts, a pinned consumer's config is verified at its pin, and a verdict names the checks its box could not run (#145).
- The `docs/CONSUMERS.md` labels-caller stub lists the same `issues:` types
  as ceremony's own caller — `edited` and `reopened` included — so a consumer
  adopting the stub wakes when an issue body's `Blocked by #N` declaration is
  edited, and when a closed issue re-enters the queue wearing labels derived
  at close. The two lists drifted apart inside PR #32; a parity test now pins
  them together, red if either file drops a type or the lists diverge.
  Adopting the widened list is a stub edit riding the pin bump to the first
  tag carrying this change (#144).
- `labels-reconcile` — a queue-cancelled duplicate check is discarded when its context holds a real verdict, so a sibling PR's eviction no longer reds a green PR; an all-cancelled context still blocks (#139).
- `blocker:unrequested` now clears the moment the panel is asked: the labels
  caller (and the `docs/CONSUMERS.md` stub) listens on `review_requested` and
  `review_request_removed`, so the one event that falsifies the label — or
  makes it true again — wakes the reconcile sweep instead of waiting for an
  unrelated push or the advisory cron. The `scope` job skips both events:
  they change no paths, and running the labeler on them widens the #130
  clobber window. Adopting the new triggers is a stub edit riding the pin
  bump to the first tag carrying this change (#137).
- `drills/README.md` no longer tells the builder to delete the scratch repo —
  a step no fleet identity can perform, because `delete_repo` is deliberately
  absent from bot tokens. The builder's end state is **archive**
  (`archived: true`, inside the `repo` scope); the delete is the operator's,
  and cleanup gates nothing — not ready-for-review, not the panel, not the
  merge. The drill record now names the scratch repo by `owner/name` and
  states the disposal its author actually observed, never one that has not
  happened: both 0.2.0 drills hit the missing-scope wall independently, one
  stalling a release draft on an impossible 403, the other shipping a record
  asserting a delete that never ran (#135).
- `lib/facts.sh` — a repository's first push to `main` (a root commit with no first parent) now reads `base_ver=(none)` and lets decide's table govern, instead of dying at exit 128 before establishing a fact; the no-base path skips the base fetch and `git show`, and an unresolvable head still fails loudly (#134).
- The changelog rule now explains why release PRs write no fragment and how entry-worthy changes land instead (#131).
- `actions/labels-scope` replaces `actions/labeler@v5` in the labels workflow's scope job: labeler wrote the whole label set (`PUT`) even under `sync-labels: false`, silently removing any label applied while it ran — #128 lost its `release` that way — so the scope job now derives from the same `.github/labeler.yml` mapping (the `changed-files`/`any-glob-to-any-file` shape, block or flow; anything else refuses loudly) and its only write is an additive `POST`. The reconcile sweep also warns — never sets — when a non-draft PR is release-shaped (bare version differing from its base) but carries no `release` label (#130).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-24

- `test/changelog-assembled.test.sh` — keep the trio interaction aligned with fragment mode: a dropped entry makes armed red too, while a hand-edited section leaves assembled as the sole red (#126).
- `actions/changelog-assembled` — a release PR's stamped section must be byte-for-byte what the fragments it consumed assemble to, replayed from the merge base; inapplicable trees pass with a NOTICE (#116).
- `changelog-armed` — treat `changelog.d/` as the arming, validate every development fragment, and require bare releases to consume the directory into their exact publishable section (#115).
- `lib/changelog.sh` + `bin/changelog-assemble` — read the `changelog.d/` fragments, assemble one release section (canonical group order, one shape per repo), and consume exactly what was published (#114).
- BUILDER.md — the directed hold is the parked claim's fifth shape, its attention demand is acknowledged in the declaration comment, and its board bookkeeping covers in-flight work; TRIAGE.md no longer excludes it (#113).
- Ceremony adopts `changelog.d/` — a PR writes one fragment per issue instead of editing `CHANGELOG.md`, the release PR assembles the section, and `## Unreleased` is gone (#112).
- BUILDER.md — the handed-off PR is the parked claim's fourth shape, its handoff is its declaration, and shape 2 covers the round awaiting its first verdicts (#109).
- `labels-reconcile` — warn once per sweep when a repository lacks labels declared by the pinned core taxonomy (#105).
- `LABELS.md` — drop the vendored scope-table enumeration; the per-repo set lives in `.github/labels.conf` and the repo's own CONTRIBUTING (#104).
- `labels-reconcile` — a degraded mergeability/checks read now logs gh's actual stderr (collapsed, bounded) beside the byte-identical counted line, and the blind-sweep warning leads with the observed reason instead of asserting the permissions cause (#101).
- Changelog publication — count entries instead of bytes, refuse dangling grouped headings, and seed grouped re-arms with Added/Changed/Fixed (#98).
- `labels-reconcile` — grant callers private-repo check reads and warn when an entire PR sweep is blind (#95).
- `labels-reconcile` — the bootstrap now retires the six GitHub defaults `LABELS.md` publishes as deleted, tolerating both an already-absent label and a refused delete (#93).
- `issueflow-reconcile` — a triage-authored issue arrival stands down with exit 0 instead of killing the run before the sweep (#91).
- FLEET.md — the assignee's `attention` wake: one role-independent trigger ahead of every per-role list, one acked session per demand; a spec on paper until `duty.sh` polls it (#86).
- `attention` doctrine — define its assignee-owned pickup, ack, queue and clock semantics across labels, triage, and builder roles (#85).
- `attention` — add the issue-only, hand-set assignee-demand flag to the core label taxonomy (#84).
- One issue at a time counts build work in flight: the parked claim's three shapes, its declared-never-inferred comment, and triage's duty to name a directed hold as a park (#77).
- FLEET.md — the operator notifier's `needs-ruling` queue (one tracked message per item, edited in place across the rungs) and triage's past-24h wake condition; a spec on paper until an operator updates the box (#74).
- The sweep observes the escalation contract: a malformed escalation is named field-by-field, and the ladder's 12h/24h rungs each draw one comment to the flag-setter — comment-only, per-episode, both surfaces (#73).
- Ruling doctrine — define every human-owned trigger, the fixed escalation shape, and the 0–24h builder-to-triage ladder (#72).
- `issueflow-reconcile` — nudge once when an `offsite` flag outlives every visible cross-referenced PR (#69).
- `offsite` — protect claimed issues whose PR lives in another repository from the claim-reclaim clock (#68).
- `issueflow-reconcile` — keep cross-repo references out of local dependency decisions and require triage to resolve cross-repo blockers by hand (#61).
- `actions/runner-isolated` — a `pull_request`-triggered job may never run on a self-hosted runner (#58).
- Cross-repo doctrine: the panel is the PR's repo's roster, a review request is authorization but not panel membership, and `Part of <repo>#N` replaces the `Closes #N` that cannot cross repos (#57).
- The sweep's `needs-ruling` invariants, one implementation for both surfaces: the issue-side staleness exemption, the bare-flag check (comment-only, the label is never removed), and the 7-day nudge to the decider (#52).
- `needs-ruling` — the cross-cutting flag for a pending human decision, excluded from `state:needs-human` and from the staleness sweep (#51).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-22

- `lib/version.sh` — one version abstraction, `file` and `package-json` backends (#3).
- `lib/changelog.sh` + `bin/changelog-section` — the one canonical changelog-section extractor (#4).
- `actions/changelog-armed` — the version-keyed arming guard (#5).
- `actions/changelog-monotonic` — shipped release headings are append-only: no deletion, no duplication (#6).
- `actions/drill-recorded` — a release tree must carry its drill record (#7).
- `lib/decide.sh` — the merge door's five-state decision, pure and exhaustively tested (#8).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` + `lib/facts.sh` — the reusable two-door release workflow (#9).
- `.github/workflows/labels.yml` + `actions/labels-reconcile` — label taxonomy bootstrap and PR-state reconciliation (#10).
- Ceremony adopts its own ceremony: `VERSION`, this changelog, the drill doctrine, the self-callers, and the self-guards in CI (#11).

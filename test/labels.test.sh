# LABELS.md is mirrored byte-identically into every governed repo, so any
# scope enumeration it carries is true at home and false everywhere else —

# The set lives in labels.conf and the repo's CONTRIBUTING; the mirror never
# names it. A concrete label is `scope:` followed by a name character — the
# doctrine spellings (bare `scope:`, wildcard `scope:*`) put a backtick or `*`
# there instead, so any name, current or future, in any shape (table row,
# name|color|description row, prose) re-reds this while doctrine stays green.

# The caller's trigger type lists and the CONSUMERS.md stub's must be the

# clears blocker:unrequested — the label sat false for as long as a quiet
# repo stayed quiet because the one event that falsifies it was never
# listed (#137). edited/reopened are the wakes for the two events that
# falsify issue labels silently — an edited body rewrites the `Blocked by
# #N` declaration the reconcile sweep parses, and a reopened issue
# re-enters the queue wearing labels derived at close; PR #32 widened the
# caller by both and the stub never followed (#144). The stub is prose, so
# nothing but these rows keeps the lists from drifting: a type in one file
# only is a wake that fires at home and nowhere in the fleet, or the
# reverse. The NF guard keeps `issues: write` under permissions: from
# matching the issues: trigger key.

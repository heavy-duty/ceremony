# --- the source tree ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# A fake ceremony: a small manifest (deliberately NOT the real vendored set —
# a command that hardcoded the doc list instead of calling docs-sync would
# pass against the real one) and a CHANGELOG.md carrying the real ladder.
#
# THE LADDER'S VERSIONS ARE THE REAL ONES on purpose, unlike the doc set: the
# migration table in bin/ceremony-upgrade names real tags, so the intervals
# these rows exercise have to be the real intervals. The bodies are stubs;
# only the headings are read.
#
# ONE FIXTURE IS AN EXCEPTION, AND IT IS DELIBERATE (#610). `stepable` stands
# on a FABRICATED rung in a SECOND source tree ($SRC_SYNTH, built below),
# because the shape it protects — a refusal that emits a runnable
# `SHORTER MOVE:` — needs a released tag strictly BETWEEN the pin and an
# unmechanised first crossing, and mechanising 0.7.0 left no real interval
# with one: of the two crossable rows still unmechanised, nothing is released
# below 0.2.0 but 0.1.0, and no released tag lies between 0.2.0 and 0.3.0.
# The shape is not retired, because it re-arms whenever a release adds an
# unmechanised row. Every OTHER fixture still uses the real intervals, and
# the fabricated rung is kept out of $SRC on purpose: that ladder is shared,
# and a rung inserted here would falsify `ancient`'s next-tag-on-the-ladder
# row and silently move the intervals every other fixture exercises.

# --- the SECOND source tree, with one fabricated rung -------------------------
#
# Built exactly like $SRC and differing from it in ONE thing: its ladder
# carries a rung, 0.2.5, that ceremony never released. It exists so `stepable`
# can keep testing a refusal that emits a RUNNABLE shorter move after
# mechanising 0.7.0 left that shape no real interval (#610) — see the
# exception on the convention above.
#
# WHY THE RUNG SITS WHERE IT DOES. The shape needs a released tag strictly
# between the pin and an unmechanised first crossing. 0.3.0 is a real,
# still-unmechanised row, and 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 are consecutive on the real
# ladder, so 0.2.5 is the one position that creates the interval: pinned at
# 0.2.0 and asked for 0.4.0, the first CROSSED migration row is 0.3.0 and the
# longest move that crosses none is 0.2.5. The fabricated tag is deliberately
# NOT a migration row itself — it is a released rung and nothing more, which
# is what makes it a legal destination.
#
# THIS LADDER IS NOT $SRC's, and must never be merged into it: $SRC is shared
# by every other fixture, and a rung added there would falsify `ancient`'s
# "the first crossed tag 0.2.0 is the next tag on the ladder" row and silently
# change the intervals the whole suite exercises.

#
# A RATCHET, NOT A PROOF. The table is carried by the command (#561 G5), so
# nothing keeps it current except a reader remembering — and the note that
# ships without its row is the silent damage the whole command exists to
# prevent. This row re-derives the tag set from the prose and fails when a
# note names a tag no row carries. It scans UNWRAPPED paragraphs, because a
# note whose version and whose "and later" fall on either side of a line
# break is invisible to a line-local grep, and that is exactly the note that
# would be missed.
#
# It cannot prove the scan complete: a note phrased in a way this regex does
# not match passes silently. It can only ensure that the notes it CAN see are
# all covered, which is one direction of the risk and the cheap one.
# availability_tags — every X.Y.Z that docs/CONSUMERS.md declares something
# AVAILABLE at, in the sense G5 names: the literal "available" within the 100
# characters before the version, and "and later" directly after it.
#
# THE 100-CHARACTER WINDOW IS THE ASSERTION, not a tuning knob. Matching on
# "the paragraph contains 'available'" was the first shape of this scan and
# it was wrong in the one way that matters: `docs/CONSUMERS.md`'s Labels
# automation block runs from the 0.3.0 note past the 0.7.7 one without a
# blank line, so a paragraph test read #501's "At `0.7.7` and later" — which
# says where an existing notice PRINTS — as an availability note, purely
# because an unrelated sentence upstream of it used the word.
#
# The text is unwrapped first: a note whose version and whose "and later"
# fall on either side of a line break is invisible to a line-local grep, and
# `0.7.0`'s and `0.1.0`'s are both exactly that (which is why #561's own body
# counts ten notes where an unwrapped scan finds more).
#
# One note is deliberately not a row, and bin/ceremony-upgrade's table
# comment names it: #501's 0.7.7, excluded by this window, and by #561's
# happy path moving 0.7.6 -> 0.7.7 and requiring it to succeed.
#
# #559's was the other, and the 0.7.8 cut ended that: its "available at
# **unreleased** and later" had no tag to key a row on, the release cleared
# the marker to `0.7.8`, and this scan found the tag before any row carried
# it — which is the ratchet firing as designed, not a regression.

# --- the transaction across the docs-sync call (codex-bot, blocking) ---------
#
# `every check runs before any write` was true of this command and false of
# the pair. docs-sync's scaffold refusal — `markers are duplicated|unbalanced`
# — fires INSIDE its fix loop, after the mirror and the root AGENTS.md stub
# are written. Sequence a pin rewrite in front of it and an otherwise-valid
# adjacent move leaves the consumer pinned forward at the target with a
# half-written mirror and none of the hand edits a pin implies: exactly the
# half-upgraded tree this command exists to make unrepresentable.
#
# A source tree of its own, because naming a guarded scaffold changes what
# docs-sync demands of EVERY consumer above.
# --- the 0.7.0 step: a crossing that asks the tree for nothing --------------
#
# 0.5.0's class exactly (#610). The premise is that release.yml's
# workflow_call interface is unchanged in name and requiredness across this
# tag, so a caller valid below it is valid at it — which makes "the plan
# writes no byte" a claim about the artifact rather than about the note. The
# two plan rows are separate on purpose: a plan that announces the crossing
# without pointing at the guide is a plan a consumer cannot act on.

# --- B8: the CRLF grant refusal names line endings (#600 E8(a)) ------------
#
# A caller written with CRLF endings refuses correctly and always did — the
# value read at the `actions:` line is `read` followed by a carriage return,
# which is not the bare `read` this step rewrites. What shipped was a message
# printing those same four visible bytes on both sides of a sentence saying
# they differ, so the reader is told to compare `actions: read` with
# `actions: read` and find it.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS THE `named` CALLER AND NOT THE BARBERSHOP ONE, which is a
# measured fact about the reach of this reading rather than a fixture
# preference. Barbershop's grant line carries a trailing hand comment, and
# `yaml_uncomment` breaks at the `#` — so the carriage return, which sits after
# that comment, is dropped with it and that caller's value compares equal.
# What CRLF actually reaches is a grant line with nothing after the value,
# which is cast's shape and this one's.

# writes a byte is caught by the --fix fixtures, but B6 states a property of
# the FUNCTION: a step_refuse on an unreached branch, a manifest read whose
# result is discarded, or an edit declaration the planner never acts on all
# change no behaviour and no output, so no fixture can see them. Only reading
# the body can. Extraction starts at the definition line and NOT at the head
# comment above it: that paragraph argues the absence in PROSE, and says
# "IT CALLS step_refuse NOWHERE" to do it, so an extractor that swallowed it
# would red every absence row unconditionally — and the obvious way out of a

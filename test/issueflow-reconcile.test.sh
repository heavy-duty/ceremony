# and the assigned flag, which needed no read at all, goes quiet with it.
# That is #247 D1's direction (a whole pass or none of it, never a verdict
# derived from a read that did not answer) and the trade `claimed`, `blocked`
# and `needs-ruling` already make. It is still a new way for that diagnostic
# to fall silent, so it is pinned here rather than left to inspection.

# the pass the failed read lives. Round 1 measured what the per-read guards
# alone left standing — a pass could remove `stale`, or mint `needs-triage`,
# and only then reach a guarded read, fail it, and report the issue as
# skipped. The sweep said it had touched nothing while a write had landed:
# the same false report #247 exists to close, one layer along.
#
# Every composition is driven TWICE against identical fixtures, differing
# only in whether the late read answers. The healthy run is the control — it
# proves the mutation is genuinely on this path, so the failing run's "no
# edit" is a fact about the guard and not about a branch that never fired.
# Executed through the sweep, because staging is a property of the pass.

# changelog-armed.sh [<changelog>] [<version-source>] [<fragments-dir>] —
# assert that the changelog is ARMED: that there is a place for the next PR's
# entry to land, and that it is the right one for the state this tree is in.
#
# Ported from box .github/scripts/changelog-armed.sh (box#108, confirmed
# cross-repo as rig#66) — box is the only repo that carries this guard
# today. Rig and cast LOST it: the naive form — "always require
# '## Unreleased' on top" — is false by construction on the ceremony PR's
# own tree, which legitimately stamps that heading away, so rig#44 and
# cast#108 both had to revert exactly that. This version-keyed form is the
# guard rig and cast regain when they adopt ceremony (#13, #15). Anyone
# tempted to simplify this back to the unconditional form should read
# those two reverts first.
#
# Fragment mode makes the directory itself the arming (#115): every PR gets
# its own issue-named file, so the box#108 clean-mismerge cannot happen because
# there is no shared heading to disappear under an open PR. The guard instead
# proves that the marker exists, Unreleased is gone, and every fragment is
# publishable before its author lets go of the PR. A bare release has no
# re-armed shape in this mode — there is nothing to re-arm — so it must have
# consumed every fragment and stamped its exact publishable section.
#
# The failure it exists to catch (box#108, rig#66) leaves no trace: the
# ceremony PR stamps '## Unreleased' into '## X.Y.Z — DATE' by hand, and
# nothing puts the heading back. A PR authored BEFORE the release wrote its
# entry under '## Unreleased'; that heading is gone by the time it merges, so
# git lands the entry under whatever heading now occupies that position — the
# just-shipped section — CLEANLY, with no conflict. The one signal an author
# would trust ("git told me to look") is absent exactly when the result is
# wrong, and the drift is only ever discovered by reading the file.
#
# The rule, keyed on the tree's version (a VERSION file or package.json,
# per version-source), because the two states are genuinely different:
#
#   version ends in -dev  ->  the top section MUST be '## Unreleased'
#   version is bare       ->  the top section may be '## Unreleased' (armed,
#                             the ceremony's own re-arm) or the stamped
#                             section for exactly that version — AND the
#                             section for that version must exist and carry
#                             prose, because it is the one about to ship
#
# The consequence worth stating plainly: a ceremony PR that stamps and forgets
# to re-arm still passes here — its version is bare, and a bare tree is
# allowed to be stamped. It goes red the moment the '-dev' bump lands on main,
# which the release workflow does automatically in the same job as the
# publish. So the guard does not block the release; it refuses to let main
# SIT disarmed, which is the window a late PR can fall into.
#
# A file of its own (not inlined in action.yml) so
# test/changelog-armed.test.sh can drive it against constructed trees for
# both states — the same discipline as the libs it sources.

  This is a HALF-DONE ceremony: the version was bumped but its section was
  never stamped — the stamp is MISSING, not misnumbered. A bare version means
  this tree is a release, and the section it is about to publish has to exist
  and have prose in it. Left alone, this passes CI, merges, and only then does
  the publisher refuse to extract the notes — on main, after the fact, with
  the release already half-shipped.

  The fix is the ceremony's first edit: stamp '## Unreleased' into
  '## $ver — DATE', then put an empty '## Unreleased' back above it.

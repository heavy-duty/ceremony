# changelog-assembled.sh [<base-ref>] [<changelog>] [<fragments-dir>] [<version-source>]
# — assert that a release PR's stamped section is EXACTLY what the fragments
# it consumed assemble to: read the fragments as of the MERGE BASE (they are
# gone from HEAD's tree — that is the point of the ceremony), replay the
# assembler's --check over that set, and compare byte-for-byte against
# changelog_section on HEAD (#116; the fragment flow is #112).
#
# The failure it exists to catch leaves no trace — the shape every guard in
# this family was bought by. bin/changelog-assemble is run BY HAND in the
# release PR, deliberately: the assembled section must land in the PR diff
# where the panel reads it (#114). Drop one fragment from the deletion and
# its entry is simply absent from the release: the file is well-formed,
# changelog-armed is green (the section exists and has prose),
# changelog-monotonic is green (no heading was deleted), and the publisher
# happily publishes the shortened section. Hand-edit one word of the
# assembled prose and the published history quietly stops being what the
# authors wrote. The only way anyone finds out is by reading the release
# body against a directory that no longer exists.
#
# Why this cannot live in changelog-armed: "the section matches the
# fragments it consumed" is not a property of a TREE — no single tree holds
# both the fragments and the section they became. It is a property of a
# DIFF: what existed at the merge base versus what HEAD stamped. That is
# exactly the argument changelog-monotonic made for being its own git-aware
# action rather than a clause inside changelog-armed, and this is the third
# guard on the same reasoning. changelog-armed.sh stays drivable against
# constructed two-file trees that are not git repos at all.
#
# The date is never compared as prose: --check prints the section BODY with
# no '## ' heading, and changelog_section extracts the body below HEAD's
# heading — so the date HEAD stamped into its heading never enters the
# comparison, and a date difference can never masquerade as a prose one.

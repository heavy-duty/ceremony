# docs-sync.sh [--check|--fix] [--source <dir>] — materialize and verify the
# `.ceremony/` doctrine mirror in a governed repo. Run from the consumer's
# repo root (the action runs after the consumer's own checkout, like every
# guard).
#
# WHY A COPY EXISTS AT ALL (the reference-vs-mirror rationale — issue #19,
# PR #17's consumption model): workflows and actions are consumed BY
# REFERENCE — GitHub fetches them from the pinned ref at run time, so no
# copy ever exists in a consumer, and nothing can drift. Documents have no
# such runtime. A document's only "runtime" is an agent reading the working
# tree of the repo it stands in, and a doc that requires a cross-repo fetch
# before it governs is a doc that sometimes goes unread. So the agent-facing
# set (the manifest, docs/VENDORED.txt) must exist IN each governed repo's
# tree. Anyone tempted to "simplify" `.ceremony/` back to a pointer at
# heavy-duty/ceremony is reinventing the sometimes-unread doc. The mirror is
# the fix, and this tool is what makes the mirror safe: machine-written
# (--fix), machine-verified (--check, in the consumer's CI on every PR), so
# drift is unrepresentable — the only kind of copy the org allows.
#
# ONE PIN GOVERNS MACHINERY AND DOCTRINE. The ref is read from the
# consumer's .github/workflows/release.yml — the single
# `uses: heavy-duty/ceremony/.github/workflows/release.yml@<ref>` line —
# never from an input or a second config file: a second pin is a second
# thing to bump, and two pins can disagree, which is exactly the drift this
# tool exists to make unrepresentable. Exactly one such line must match;
# zero or several is a refusal that names the file — this tool never
# guesses a ref. Commented-out lines do not count: ceremony's own
# release.yml carries the pin shape inside its header essay, and any
# consumer that pastes a documentation snippet into a comment would
# otherwise appear to have two pins.
#
# THE MIRROR IS EXACT — manifest ∪ `.ceremony/`, nothing else. A drifted
# file, a missing file, an extra file not in the manifest, or no
# `.ceremony/` at all each fails --check with a message naming the offender
# and the fix; --fix writes AND deletes (a manifest removal must remove the
# vendored copy — mirror means mirror, or "extra" files accumulate as
# unverified doctrine).
#
# AND THE MIRROR IS PLAIN FILES. A symlink committed anywhere this tool
# touches — a vendored path, a subdirectory, `.ceremony/` itself, the root
# AGENTS.md — redirects the tool outside the mirror: cp writes THROUGH the
# link (anywhere the CI token can reach), cmp reads through it and reports
# the target's bytes as the mirror's, and a `find -type f` scan skips link
# nodes entirely, so the stray poses as doctrine while staying invisible
# (PR #43's review round, both findings reproduced). So both modes refuse
# any non-regular node before touching anything: the fix for a symlink is
# a human deleting it, never a tool following it.
#
# TWO FILES ARE SPECIAL, both deliberately:
#   * `.ceremony/README.md` is GENERATED here — the machine-managed marker
#     plus where the pin lives — instead of per-file banners, so every
#     vendored file stays byte-identical to its source and the check is a
#     plain cmp, never a strip-the-banner parse. It is verified like
#     everything else (against the generated text, not the source tree):
#     the file that says "a hand edit goes red" must itself go red when
#     hand-edited, or the marker is the one unverified spot in the mirror.
#   * the consumer's ROOT AGENTS.md is scaffolded once by --fix and never
#     overwritten. Agent harnesses auto-load root AGENTS.md (the cross-agent
#     convention), so the stub is what makes "you are a reviewer here" a
#     sufficient launch prompt — but it is per-repo content the moment the
#     repo edits it, so --check asserts only that it exists.
#
# A file of its own so test/docs-sync.test.sh can drive both modes against
# constructed source and consumer trees. --source <dir> substitutes a local
# ceremony checkout for the tarball fetch: offline tests, and previewing a
# ceremony PR against a consumer before anything is released. The pin is
# still read and validated with --source — a consumer without its one pin
# line has nothing for the mirror to be verified against.

# .ceremony/ — the vendored doctrine mirror

Machine-managed by heavy-duty/ceremony's `actions/docs-sync`. Never edit
these files here: they are byte-identical copies of
[heavy-duty/ceremony](https://github.com/heavy-duty/ceremony) at this
repository's pinned ref, and CI re-diffs them on every PR — a hand edit
goes red. They are changed in heavy-duty/ceremony, through its own flow,
and arrive here when the pin moves.

The pin lives in `.github/workflows/release.yml` — the single
`uses: heavy-duty/ceremony/.github/workflows/release.yml@<ref>` line. One
pin governs machinery and doctrine alike: bump it and re-sync this mirror
in the same PR (`docs-sync --fix`, or let the red check on the bump PR say
what is stale).

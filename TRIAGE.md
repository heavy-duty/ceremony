# TRIAGE.md — the triage role

You are the only door issues come through. Humans and agents open **discussions**;
you decide what becomes work and set the quality builders and reviewers receive.

## Why this door exists

Discussions may be ambiguous; issues may not: a builder must be able to execute
one **without asking anything**. One accountable role keeps builders from guessing.

## Your inputs

- **Every open discussion** in the repo you serve.
- **Stray issues** — anything filed directly, by anyone. Label it
  `needs-triage`, then either bring it up to contract (below) or convert its
  substance back into a discussion and close it, saying why. Route the work
  without shaming the filer.

## For each discussion, converge on exactly one outcome

1. **Answer.** The question has an answer, the bug is not one, the idea is
   already shipped or tracked. Link the code, doc, or issue; mark answered.
2. **Ask.** Real work is hiding behind ambiguity you cannot resolve from the
   repo, its history, or its docs. Ask the 2–3 pointed questions whose
   answers would let you write the issue — then stop and wait. Do not mint an
   issue that carries the ambiguity forward; that just moves your job onto
   the builder.
3. **Escalate.** The pending thing is a decision only a human owns — org
   policy, published artifacts, secrets, prod, or any choice whose cost lands
   outside the work. A panel deadlock is one instance, not the definition
   (#50 D11). Say precisely what the decision is, name the decider, and use
   [BUILDER.md's canonical ruling template](BUILDER.md#the-ruling-ask),
   including its options, recommendation, blocked/continues statement, and
   reversible-only default rules (#50 D12–D13).
   The discussion is where humans decide; wait there. When the decision
   blocks something already on the board — an existing issue, or minted work
   a discussion's ruling gates — set `needs-ruling` on it too, so the board
   shows where the human's turn is; the issue keeps its queue label.
   When you direct a builder to hold a claim, say the claim is **parked**,
   name what it waits on, and set `attention` so the assignee's ack is visible
   on the board — the directive and the builder's doctrine
   ([BUILDER.md](BUILDER.md#claiming)) must use one word.
   Immediately before asserting label-borne state in prose — a hold, a
   claim, a queue state, whether in a comment, a body header, or a
   `needs-ruling` ask — re-read that issue's **label events**
   (`gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/timeline`), not just its
   comments: the answer often arrives as a label with no comment, and a
   write that re-read only the thread races it (#149, #151).
   Past 24 hours from the current episode's `labeled` event, if the ruling
   still stands and doubt remains, it is triage's duty to pick the option the
   builder proceeds on, record that pick as a decision, and stay accountable
   for it; the operator may overturn it at merge (#50 D13–D14). **That duty
   does not reach a flag borne by an issue whose escalation reads `Default:
   none — hard block`**: there the 24h and past-24h rungs do not fire at all,
   the flag waits for the human, and what is owed at each of them is a
   published re-read of the default against what has landed — never a pick
   (#526). The reason is the one the rung itself gives, *"the operator may
   overturn it at merge"*: a pick made on a pull request gets a second look
   before anything lands, an issue has no second look, and where the pick
   would tick an acceptance criterion the tick is the terminal act. A flag
   borne by a **pull request** runs the full ladder unchanged, and an
   issue-borne flag carrying a **timed, reversible** default still expires
   under the 0–12h rung — the carve-out is keyed on the hard block, not on
   the surface alone ([BUILDER.md](BUILDER.md#the-ruling-ask),
   [LABELS.md](LABELS.md)). You set the
   flag, so you also close it out ([LABELS.md](LABELS.md)): judge when
   agreement is reached, record the ruling as a decision in one comment,
   remove the label, and return the issue to its flow in that same comment;
   when that ruling or any directive or answered builder question delivers
   the assignee's next move in prose, set `attention` in the same comment on
   the assigned issue that owns the claim — never on the pull request, even
   when the comment lives there. Flagging an unassigned issue is a board bug,
   not a demand; repair the board rather than setting `attention`.
   This is not a substitute for minting work or for `needs-ruling`.
4. **Decline.** Real idea, wrong repo or wrong time. Say why plainly, link
   where it belongs if anywhere, close. A refusal with reasons is a good
   outcome; a zombie discussion is not.
5. **Accept.** It justifies work → mint the issue(s). The contract below is
   the bar.

**Where the vendored set is what blocks you, route the finding upstream —
this is not a sixth outcome.** When normalizing or minting is stopped by the
doctrine you were handed rather than by anything on this board — a rule that
cannot express the case, a rule contradicting another, a rule naming no
mechanism — the fix has exactly one legal address and it is not here, so do
not settle for prose in the repo you serve: raise it as a discussion in the
repository the vendored set is mirrored from, which `.ceremony/README.md`
names and links, carrying the rule quoted at this repo's pin, the case it
cannot express, the workaround now in force and what would retire it, and
cite that discussion wherever that workaround ships — while a finding whose
fix is in the tree you serve stays here and is one of the five above (#492).

## The issue contract

Every issue you mint carries, in this order:

- **A title that names the deliverable** — "lib/version.sh — one version
  abstraction, two backends", never "improve version handling".
- **Context**: why this exists, with links — the discussion it came from,
  the code it touches (permalinks at a pinned SHA, so line references cannot
  rot), prior art in sibling repos.
- **The spec**: decisions made, not options listed. If the spec still has an
  open question **of its own**, the issue is not ready to exist — go back to
  outcome 2 or 3. A spec that is complete and deliberately scoped **around**
  an open question live **elsewhere** is the other shape and is mintable:
  what makes it ready is that its deliverable needs no answer from that
  question, not that the question has one.

  **Scoping around one puts the scope on every clause that mandates work, in
  its own text.** A builder implementing the clause literally must not be
  able to reach the reserved case, so a reservation stated once — beside the
  mandates rather than inside them — is not self-enforcing.

  **Never assert what the prose you are commissioning cannot reach.** That is
  a claim about text nobody has written yet, so the builder inherits the
  assertion instead of checking the property. State the scope; do not predict
  the text (#615).
- **Tasks**: the steps, checkboxed, in order.
- **Acceptance criteria**: checkboxed, verifiable, and honest — these become
  the builder's definition of done and the reviewer's review spec, verbatim.
  **The split is decided at the mint.** Ask of each criterion whether its
  evidence can exist before the PR merges; a criterion whose evidence cannot
  is **not carried by this issue** — it is minted as its own issue, which
  declares this one as its blocker. Asking at the mint rather than at the
  merge is what keeps an issue's close one event instead of a queue (#151,
  #536).

  **That successor issue carries the outstanding criteria verbatim**, has one
  owner class — builder-owned or operator-owned, never both — and names its
  evidence surface, the command or observation that produces the evidence,
  and the wake condition that brings someone back to tick it. It cites the
  issue it was split from.

  **Classify each criterion at mint on a second axis as well: who can
  produce its evidence.** A builder's session is not assumed to reach the
  host it runs on, the hardware under it, or the network beyond itself.
  Ask what command or observation proves the criterion and where that has
  to run; where the answer is a surface a builder's session cannot reach —
  a host, physical hardware, a credentialed or paid external service, a
  production system — the criterion is **operator-owned**. The input to
  that call is the evidence and never a builder's report or a particular
  session's capabilities, a builder that has to report it having already
  paid for the omission (#487).

  **Everything else is builder-owned**, reach being measured against the
  session's boundary and not its convenience: slowness, inconvenience, and a
  fixture nobody has written yet are work rather than distance, and evidence
  the board's own automation produces is reachable by anyone who can read it.
  **That boundary is not the same in every builder session**, so a
  builder-owned criterion may require a **named session capability** — a
  vendor CLI, an authenticated session, a profile — and where it does, the
  criterion states three things in its own text, not in a comment and not in
  a covering sentence: that it is **builder-owned and not operator-owned**,
  **the capability it requires**, and **what a builder lacking it does** —
  release the claim, never substitute documentation for the evidence. A named
  capability is a property of the criterion and not a class of criterion: it
  adds no third value to the two above, a session lacking it having a shorter
  reach rather than a different one (#575).

  **An operator-owned criterion carries three things in its own text**, not
  in a comment and not in a covering sentence: that it is operator-owned,
  **its evidence** — the command, and the surface that command must run on —
  and **its wake condition**, the event that brings someone back to tick it.
  A criterion saying only that it is operator-owned is incomplete.

  **Reach is the axis classified at mint, and after #536 it is the only
  one.** A criterion whose evidence cannot exist before the merge is not
  carried by the issue at all, so there is no second classification left to
  make: the after-close question is answered by the mint-time split above,
  and never by a second axis read off a criterion the issue keeps (#536).

  **When every acceptance criterion is operator-owned at mint, add
  `operator` alongside the issue's queue label.** That issue's body names the
  evidence surface, the command or observation that produces the evidence,
  and the wake condition.

  **An issue is builder-owned or operator-owned, and never both.** One that
  would carry criteria of both classes is not minted: it is split at the
  mint, and one found mixed later is split where it stands. This **replaces**
  the rule that a lone operator-owned criterion among builder-owned ones left
  the issue unmarked and kept the per-criterion mechanism. Such a criterion no
  longer stays where it is; it relocates, by the route below (#491, #488).

  **That reversal is at the issue level only.** What #491 also said — that
  issue ownership is not read off criterion reach — is what changes, and only
  because an issue may no longer hold both classes: with mixing forbidden, an
  issue's class follows from its criteria's because there is nothing else left
  for it to be. Criterion reach and issue ownership remain different
  questions; the second now has one admissible answer (#491, #488).

  **Where an issue's remaining acceptance criteria include operator-owned
  ones, relocate them — do not route the issue around them.** The
  operator-owned criteria move **verbatim** into their own issue; the original
  is left with a remainder that is wholly PR-checkable; and its PR merges with
  `Closes #N`. The evidence is neither waited on at the merge door nor
  deferred past it. It becomes tracked work carrying its own claim and its
  own wake condition, which is the whole of the route: an issue is not held
  open to remember something a separate issue can hold (#488).

  **The relocation precedes the merge.** Before the merge it is a route;
  after the merge it is a repair — the same moves, but performed on an issue
  that has already closed on criteria nothing checked. Doing it in time is
  part of the rule and not advice about it (#488).

  **A relocation enumerates the moved criteria one at a time, against the
  original.** The new issue's body records which criteria it carries,
  criterion by criterion; the original records which it shed, the same way. A
  relocation that asserts its coverage in a summary sentence has stated
  nothing anyone can check, and a summary that was false when written is what
  this requirement comes from (#488).

  **Two or more relocations may share one operator-owned issue when they name
  the same evidence surface and the same command or observation.** This is a
  permission, not a requirement: triage may still mint one issue per
  relocation where that reads better. Relocations naming different evidence
  surfaces never share an issue. The shared issue names every originating
  issue, enumerates the criteria it carries per originating issue, and gates
  them all; each originating issue still records which criteria it shed. The
  shared issue remains all-operator-owned and takes `ready` + `operator`
  unchanged (#532).

  **The same command means one invocation on the same surface produces every
  piece of evidence.** Two different commands run in one sitting on the same
  host do not qualify: sharing a schedule is not sharing a command (#532).

  **The relocated issue is all-operator-owned at its own mint**, so it takes
  `ready` + `operator` under the rule above, and its body names the evidence
  surface, the command or observation, and the wake condition. This
  commissions no new mechanism: route D's output is exactly the artifact that
  rule already mandates (#488).

  **A criterion whose evidence turns out at claim time to be beyond a
  builder's reach is a defect in the issue, and the body is yours.**
  Reclassify it where it stands, in the same tick — a comment that answers
  the builder while the body still asks for proof no builder can produce
  leaves the next reader the same issue (#149). Reclassifying it
  operator-owned is what makes the issue mixed, so the relocation above is
  the rest of the same repair and not a later one; the builder's claim waits
  on it and on nothing else (#488).
- **Test plan**: what proves it, including the cases that must fail.
- **Dependencies**: `Blocked by #N` / `Blocks #N`, and `Part of #E` when an
  epic organizes it. Name a cross-repo dependency the same way with its
  repository qualified (`Blocked by repo#N` or `owner/repo#N`); the sweep
  cannot resolve it, so triage verifies it and flips the issue by hand.
  When a deliverable is already carried by an open `ready`, `claimed`, or
  `blocked` issue, the carriers get an unconditional collision edge;
  disjoint regions never excuse it. Precedence decides the edge's direction,
  and arrival order breaks an equal-precedence tie by putting the newer issue
  behind the newest open carrier. This keeps every `ready` issue concurrently
  claimable and makes each close release one successor (#288, #425).

  Precedence has exactly two classes. **Front row** means that leaving the
  issue unfixed breaks the flow for builds other than the issue's own: for
  example, repository-wide red CI, a guard fabricating verdicts, a sweep
  mislabelling the board, a release door rejecting valid cuts, or a vendored
  action reding its consumers. The bar is measured breadth, not urgency; an
  issue affecting only the build it would produce is **ordinary**, however
  urgent it is. Everything not proven front row is ordinary. Front-row ties
  are settled by breadth first, then by the newest-carrier rule above. If the
  class is uncertain, use ordinary: a mistaken insertion blocks a builder and
  creates an unplanned rebase, while an ordinary route can be re-ruled before
  it lands (#425).

  A front-row issue X inserted ahead of an unclaimed chain A → B takes
  exactly three writes: X declares no blocker and is minted `ready`; A adds
  `Blocked by X` and moves `ready` → `blocked`; B is untouched because it
  already reaches X through A. Moving a displaced `ready` issue back to
  `blocked` is the legitimate price of the insertion, and re-pointing B would
  fan the chain (#425).

  **Owner classes gate through the same edges.** Where a fix needs
  builder-owned work and then operator evidence, the shape is
  `builder-owned issue → operator-owned issue → the gated issue`, and the
  gated issue declares **the operator-owned issue alone**: it reaches the
  builder-owned one through it, by the transitivity the front-row insertion
  already relies on. A shared operator-owned middle node is legitimate: each
  gated issue declares that shared node alone and reaches its own builder-owned
  predecessor through it. Declaring both is not wrong, but the single edge is
  the house form, and fanning the chain is the thing to avoid (#488, #532).

  A claimed issue, or one carrying an open PR, is never retro-blocked and no
  label on it moves. The front-row issue still lands first, but the collision
  is ordered at merge: the later merge rebases onto the front-runner. Record
  that order and rebase direction on both issues when inserting the
  front-runner. The new issue's Dependencies also records the class and the
  measurement that proves its breadth, every edge moved and its direction,
  and any claimed issue whose merge is ordered this way. A claim of urgency
  without measurements remains ordinary (#425).

  For example, given an ordinary chain #1 → #2, a measured defect #3 that
  reds CI for #1, #2 and unrelated builds is front row. If #1 is unclaimed,
  the route becomes #3 → #1 → #2 by changing #1 alone; if #1 is claimed,
  its labels stay put and its PR rebases onto #3 before it merges. This is the
  governed-repository CI failure that produced the rule (#425).

  Precedence changes only the direction of a collision edge; it never permits
  an issue to omit one. It also does not make an issue a member of a standing
  release window, whose membership remains the operator's release-init call
  (#292, #343, #425).
  During a standing release window, every mint also gets a binary membership
  call in the same tick. A non-member names the release issue as its blocker
  in its own Dependencies. A member is placed with three writes: the new issue
  names its immediate member predecessors; every member whose immediate
  predecessor the new issue becomes adds or re-points its dependency to the
  new issue, dropping any predecessor the new issue now reaches (inserting X
  into A → B makes A → X → B, so B drops A); a member that must land after the
  new issue but already reaches it through another member declares nothing
  new; and the release issue adds a row for the new issue to its membership
  record, which records membership only and is the only place the sweep reads
  it — a release issue's `Blocked by` line answers its predecessor gate and
  never its membership (#292, #343). Collision and window edges are
  independent, so write both when both apply.
- **Pull requests**, and only once a chain exists: a `## Pull requests`
  section listing the issue's PRs in chain order, appended to as the chain
  grows and never rewritten. A builder cuts
  a PR at the close of its fifth round, continuing the branch in a successor
  and closing the predecessor ([BUILDER.md](BUILDER.md#the-round-cap)) — and
  because the predecessor closes, this list is the only place the chain stays
  navigable. **You** maintain it: the body is yours, the builder never edits
  it, and the builder's cut comment on the issue is your trigger to append the
  successor. An issue whose work fitted one PR grows no such section.
- **Labels**: type (`bug`/`enhancement`/`documentation`), `scope:*`, and
  exactly one of `ready` / `blocked` (see [LABELS.md](LABELS.md)). Repairing
  any governed board's own missing label taxonomy is the exception: it is
  operator-owned and passes no mint door, because GitHub's `triage` role can
  neither create labels nor dispatch workflows. Name the missing rows and the
  verified `workflow_dispatch` press with `bootstrap=yes` to the operator,
  then stop and mint nothing (#524).

The bar, stated once: **a competent builder who has read only this issue and
the repo can succeed.** The release-ceremony epic and its children
(heavy-duty/ceremony#1–#16) are the house exemplars — that is the density
expected.

## Sizing

Before minting, ask whether one builder can carry the work to a verdict in a
bounded number of review rounds. If not, accept the work as an epic with
children that each meet the issue contract. @danmt's rule of thumb is: *"is
the PR to fix this issue complex? yes? then its an epic and has multiple
issues that are ideally disjointed, we avoid having multiple issues touching
the same few lines of a file, group when we can without introducing
overwhelming complexity."* (#416)

Splitting does not promise parallel work. Under the collision contract, `k`
children on one shared deliverable form a `k`-deep serial chain, one claim at
a time (#288). The split that pays is across disjoint deliverables; the
contract offers no discount for near-disjoint ones. That idle time is a
priced cost, not a defect to route around: @danmt ruled, *"I'd rather have
multiple issues idle due to blocking than super large PRs that never close."*
(#416)

A PR that keeps generating review rounds is evidence that its issue was
mis-sized. Feed that evidence into the next mint; it is not a gate and does
nothing to the PR already in flight. Sizing adds no label, never turns a large
idea into a decline, and does not require an epic for every multi-file change.
An idea too large to specify still takes outcome 2, **Ask**: splitting never
justifies minting an incomplete spec.

## Multi-issue work

When an acceptance produces more than one issue, mint an **epic** (`epic`
label) with the approach, decisions, constraints, and a dependency-ordered
child checklist. Children reference the epic; that checklist is the progress
view. For every epic, put it under a heading
literally `## Task list`, matched case-insensitively with nothing but optional
trailing whitespace; any other heading is invisible to the sweep and draws
neither a warning nor a completion nudge (#266). The heading and each row open
on up to three leading spaces — four or more open nothing, and a leading tab
counts as four — and the same bound closes the list at the next heading. A
task row is a checkbox row under any Markdown list marker and only those:
`-`, `*`, `+`, and 1 to 9 digits followed by `.` or `)`. No line inside a
fenced code block is a heading or a row, so an example task list quoted in a
fence enrols nothing — which is what lets an epic body show the record's own
form (#349). Builders never pick the epic itself. Keep the checklist current — a stale epic misleads every scan.
Repositories that adopt version epics follow [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).

## Backlog hygiene

- **Dedup and size before minting** — search issues *and* closed issues;
  extend or reopen before duplicating, then apply [Sizing](#sizing) to the
  acceptance.
- The issue-flow sweep flips `blocked` → `ready` when every named dependency
  lands, and flags a blocked issue whose dependency declaration is unreadable.
- The sweep reclaims abandoned claims after 48 hours: `claimed` + no open PR
  + no activity → comment, unassign, restore `ready`.
- In the close-out tick, clear any remaining queue label and assignee when the
  sweep has not already done so; the claim ends with the issue (#547).
- At mint, express the owner class by setting `operator` or leaving it absent.
  The sweep derives the complementary `builder` row; triage never hand-writes
  it.
- Automation never guesses intent. Resolve the conflict comments it leaves on
  malformed queue states, and close or extend completed epics when nudged.
- **Close obsolete issues** with the reason and a link to what obsoleted
  them. Every label on every open issue stays true; the board is only worth
  scanning if it does not lie.
- **A lifted hold makes its body prose stale in the same instant, and the
  body is yours.** When a hold lifts, correct the body header that described
  it in the same tick — do not leave it to the builder or next reader (#149).

## What you never do

- Write code, review code, or build the thing yourself.
- Assign a builder — builders pick and claim ([BUILDER.md](BUILDER.md)).
- Make the human's decisions (outcome 3 exists for those), or soften a
  refusal into a vague issue to avoid saying no.
- Mint an issue to "discuss" something — that is a discussion.

# lib/version.sh — one version abstraction, two backends (issue #3).
#
# Sourced, never executed: no set -e/-u here — the sourcing script owns its
# own shell options. No git in this lib either: "version at the base commit"
# is the caller's job (git show / git worktree the base tree, then point
# version_read at it) — keeping the lib pure keeps its tests trivial.
#
# Backends ($1 of version_read / version_write):
#   file          — a VERSION file in the tree (box, rig, incubator)
#   package-json  — package.json's version field (cast)

# version_read <backend> [dir] — print the version; fail loudly on a
# missing/empty source. A wrong release is worse than a missing one, so
# every unreadable state is exit 1 with a message, never an empty print.

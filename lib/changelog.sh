# it exists, so malformedness fails the PR that wrote it, not the release
# that consumes it. The rules, and the failure each refuses:
#   - name '<issue>.md' or '<repo>-<issue>.md': anything else has no
#     derivable order, and an invented name is the "two builders, one
#     filename" collision the naming scheme exists to avoid (#112 D2);
#   - no '## ' line: the section heading is the assembler's to write, and
#     a smuggled one would split the published section;
#   - at least one bullet: a heading is not an entry — the rule the
#     publisher enforces at release time, moved onto the PR;
#   - no '### ' heading without a bullet before the next heading or EOF:
#     the dangling grouped heading #98 taught us to refuse.

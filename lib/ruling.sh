# lib/ruling.sh — the `needs-ruling` sweep invariants (issues #52 and #73,
# epic #50).
#
# Both reconcilers source this file: the bare-flag check, the escalation
# shape check, the ladder's rung comments and the 7-day nudge are ONE
# implementation serving both surfaces — two copies of a 7-day rule is how
# the family got here in the first place (#50). Pure decisions sit above
# the divider (facts in, verdict out); the one impure orchestrator below
# talks to gh and posts through the sourcing script's run()/log().
#
# Standing rules this file lives under:
#   - The machine never sets or clears `needs-ruling` (#50 D9). Nothing here
#     mutates a label; the only writes are comments. Pinned by a sweep-probe
#     test and a grep-level check over the mutation calls.
#   - The machine never judges prose (#50 D4). "Did the escalation contract
#     accompany the flag" is decided by a mechanical proxy: the actor who
#     applied the label has a comment timestamped no earlier than 15 minutes
#     before the `labeled` event. The back-window exists because the natural
#     ordering is post-the-escalation-then-set-the-label, seconds apart; a
#     strictly-after rule would flag every correctly-formed escalation.
#   - The failure direction is always *flag*, never *act*: a bare flag is
#     commented on, never removed (removing would delete somebody's
#     escalation on the strength of a timestamp heuristic), and an
#     unreadable timeline does nothing at all — an unreadable fact must
#     never invent a verdict (the reconciler's standing rule).

# One constant, both surfaces — the whole reason this file exists. 7 days
# (#50 D10): long enough that an active back-and-forth is never nudged,
# short enough that a forgotten ruling surfaces within the week.
